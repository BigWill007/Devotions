                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.</p>
                    <p>— John 15:8 (ESV)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="devotional-text">
                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>In our achievement-oriented culture, busyness is often worn as a badge of honor. When someone asks how we're doing, our default response is frequently, "I'm so busy!" But there's a crucial difference between a life that's full and a life that's fruitful.</p>
                    <p>Many Christians prioritize success or comfort over fruitfulness. We fill our calendars with activities, responsibilities, and commitments, leaving little margin for the things that truly matter. We might even fill our lives with fun and entertainment, which isn't inherently wrong but can distract us from deeper purpose. The result is lives that are full but not necessarily fruitful.</p>
                    <p>Jesus calls us to something different. He desires that we "bear much fruit," demonstrating that we are truly His disciples. This fruit isn't measured by how many items we check off our to-do lists or how many activities we juggle. Rather, it's measured by transformation—both in us and through us to others. Being fruitful means "Jesus is changing you and using you to change others."</p>
                    <p>One powerful question to ask is, "How could I be more fruitful?" Apply this question to different areas of your life: How could my marriage be more fruitful? How could my time at work be more fruitful? How could my relationships with my children or parents be more fruitful? When we genuinely ask these questions, "the path appears." God begins to show us what needs to change.</p>
                    <p>The answers might challenge us. We might need to say "no" to good things to say "yes" to the best things. We might need to create margin in our schedules for relationships and ministry opportunities. We might need to reevaluate how we spend our time, money, and energy.</p>
                    <p>Jesus reminds us that bearing fruit brings glory to the Father. When our lives produce the fruit of the Spirit—love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23)—God is honored. When others come to know Christ through our witness, God is glorified. When we serve others in Jesus's name, the Father receives praise.</p>
                    <p>Today, consider whether your life is merely full or truly fruitful. Ask God to help you prioritize fruitfulness over busyness, significance over success, and eternal impact over temporary achievement.</p>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Heavenly Father, forgive me for the times I've confused a full life with a fruitful one. Help me to see where I've been prioritizing busyness, success, or comfort over true fruitfulness. Show me what needs to change in my schedule, my priorities, and my heart. I want my life to bring glory to You through bearing much fruit. Help me to make choices that lead to greater fruitfulness, even when those choices are difficult or countercultural. May others see the fruit of Your Spirit in my life and be drawn to You as a result. In Jesus's name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Choose one area of your life (work, family, ministry, etc.) and ask, "How could this be more fruitful?" Write down three specific changes you could make to increase fruitfulness in this area. Commit to implementing at least one of these changes this week.</p>
