                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>Matthew 4:20-22 (ESV)</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them. Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
                    </blockquote>

                <div class="devotional-text">
                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>There's a word that appears twice in this short passage, and it's worth our attention: "immediately." Both sets of brothers—Peter and Andrew, then James and John—responded to Jesus' call without delay. They didn't hesitate. They didn't negotiate. They didn't create a five-year transition plan. They responded immediately.</p>
                    <p>But what exactly did they leave behind? The text tells us they left their nets, their boat, and even their father. These weren't small sacrifices. Their nets and boats represented their livelihood, their security, their identity. And leaving their father wasn't just about family relationships—it was about leaving the family business, the inheritance, the plan that had been laid out for them.</p>
                    <p>This raises an important question for us: What are the "nets" in our lives that we need to leave behind to follow Jesus more fully?</p>
                    <p>For some, these nets might be harmful habits or addictions that entangle us and keep us from moving forward with Jesus. For others, they might be unhealthy relationships that pull us away from God rather than toward Him. Still others might need to let go of certain beliefs or attitudes that don't align with Jesus' teaching.</p>
                    <p>The nets could also be good things that have become ultimate things—career ambitions, financial security, comfort, or even family expectations. Sometimes what holds us back isn't bad in itself, but it has taken a place in our hearts that only Jesus should occupy.</p>
                    <p>James and John didn't just leave their nets; they also left their father. This doesn't mean that following Jesus requires abandoning family responsibilities. Rather, it shows that our primary allegiance must be to Jesus, even above family ties. Jesus himself said, "Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me" (Matthew 10:37).</p>
                    <p>What's striking about this passage is that these disciples left everything without knowing exactly where Jesus would lead them. They didn't have a detailed roadmap. They simply trusted that following Him was worth whatever they might leave behind.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>What specific things might Jesus be asking you to "leave behind" to follow Him more fully?</li>
                        <li>Why is it sometimes difficult to immediately obey when Jesus calls us to change direction?</li>
                        <li>How have you experienced God's provision after letting go of something to follow Him?</li>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Lord Jesus, thank You for calling me to follow You. I confess that I often cling to my "nets"—the things that give me a sense of security, identity, or comfort apart from You. Give me the courage to identify what I need to leave behind, and the faith to do it immediately when You call. Help me to trust that whatever I might lose in following You is nothing compared to what I gain. Show me the specific areas of my life where I need to let go and step out in faith. In Your name I pray, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Take time to identify one specific "net" in your life that may be holding you back from fully following Jesus. It might be a habit, a relationship, an attitude, or even a good thing that has taken too central a place in your life. Write down a concrete step you can take today to begin letting go of this net.</p>
