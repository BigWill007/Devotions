                    <p>Matthew 16:18 (ESV)</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>"I will build my church."</p>
                    <p>These words of Jesus in Matthew 16:18 mark the first mention of the church in the Bible. It's a significant moment that reveals Jesus's heart for His people and His plan for advancing His kingdom.</p>
                    <p>But what exactly is the church? Many people have misconceptions. Some think of the church as a building with stained glass and steeples. Others think of it as an event that happens on Sunday mornings. Still others view it as a social club for like-minded people or a nonprofit organization that does good deeds.</p>
                    <p>Jesus had something much more profound in mind. The Greek word for church is "ekklesia," which comes from two words: "ek" meaning "out of" and "kaleo" meaning "to call." Literally, the church is a "called-out people who gather on purpose."</p>
                    <p>This definition reveals two important aspects of the church. First, we are called out. Jesus calls us out of sin, out of the world's value system, out of worshiping idols that don't love us back, out of darkness and ignorance. The call to follow Christ is always a call to leave something behind.</p>
                    <p>This isn't easy. It means leaving behind habits that have become comfortable, relationships that might be harmful, values that are contrary to God's Word, and idols that promise fulfillment but never deliver. It means swimming against the cultural current and often facing misunderstanding or rejection.</p>
                    <p>But secondly, we are called to gather. We're not just called away from something; we're called to something. We're called to gather with God's people around God's Word. We're called to worship together, grow together, serve together, and witness together.</p>
                    <p>This gathering isn't optional or incidental to our faith. It's essential. God created us for community. From the beginning, He said, "It is not good that man should be alone" (Genesis 2:18). The New Testament is filled with "one another" commands that can only be fulfilled in community: love one another, serve one another, bear one another's burdens, forgive one another, encourage one another.</p>
                    <p>The practice of gathering is ancient. From Moses gathering Israel around the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai to the early church gathering in homes and synagogues, God's people have always been a gathering people. Even in our modern context with technology and online options, there's something irreplaceable about physically gathering with other believers.</p>
                    <p>Jesus promises that He will build His church and "the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." This is a powerful image. Gates are defensive structures. Jesus is saying that His church won't just hold its ground; it will be on the offensive, pushing back the gates of hell. The church isn't a fortress where believers hide from the world; it's an advancing army that brings light to darkness and life to death.</p>
                    <p>Today, consider your connection to Christ's church. Are you allowing yourself to be called out of the world's values and systems? Are you gathering regularly with other believers for worship, growth, and mission? Are you participating in the advancing work of the kingdom, pushing back the gates of hell in your sphere of influence?</p>
                    <p>In this powerful passage, Jesus reveals the true nature of the church. It's not just a building or an organization, but a community of called-out people who have recognized Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God.</p>
                    <p>Peter's confession is the foundation stone of the church: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." This recognition of Jesus' true identity is what makes discipleship possible. Without this foundation, our attempts at following Jesus are built on sand.</p>
                    <p>The church is Jesus' chosen instrument for His kingdom work. He says He will build His church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. This is a powerful promise of victory and protection for those who are part of His church.</p>
                    <p>But being part of the church comes with responsibility. Jesus gives the keys of the kingdom to His disciples, giving them authority to bind and loose. This means that as part of the church, we have a role in declaring and living out the kingdom of God.</p>
                    <p>The cost of discipleship involves not just personal commitment, but also becoming part of this called-out community. It means submitting to the authority of Christ through His church, being accountable to other believers, and using our gifts for the building up of the body.</p>

                    <p>Lord Jesus, thank You for building Your church and including me in it. Thank You for calling me out of darkness into Your marvelous light. Help me to leave behind anything that hinders my relationship with You and embrace the new identity and community You've given me. Thank You for the gift of gathering with other believers. Help me to prioritize this practice and to contribute my gifts and presence to the body of Christ. Use me and Your church to push back the gates of hell in our world, bringing Your light, love, and truth to places of darkness. In Your name I pray, Amen.</p>
