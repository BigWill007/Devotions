                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.</p>
                    <p>— John 15:2 (ESV)</p>

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>In today's passage, we encounter a challenging but essential aspect of spiritual growth: pruning. "If you're going to be fruitful, it's going to be painful." This isn't a message we often highlight in our comfort-oriented culture, but it's a biblical truth we need to embrace.</p>
                    <p>God appears in this passage as a gardener or vinedresser. While this might initially evoke warm, fuzzy feelings, a gardener is fundamentally a judge—one who inspects the garden and makes decisions about what stays and what goes. A good gardener cuts away what's unproductive to promote greater fruitfulness.</p>
                    <p>Pruning is the process of cutting away that which hinders growth. Sometimes God prunes dead or diseased areas of our lives—sinful habits, harmful relationships, or destructive thought patterns. Other times, surprisingly, He might prune things that appear healthy but are actually diverting energy from fruit-bearing. This could be good activities that aren't the best use of our gifts, or comfortable routines that keep us from new growth opportunities.</p>
                    <p>There are three primary ways God prunes us:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>First, through the Holy Spirit bringing conviction. You might notice things bothering you that didn't used to—perhaps how you spend your time, how you speak to others, or attitudes you've harbored. This internal prompting is often God's pruning shears at work.</li>
                        <li>Second, through other people—both their example and their correction. Sometimes seeing another believer's fruitfulness highlights areas where you need growth. Other times, a direct word from a trusted friend or mentor reveals blind spots you couldn't see yourself.</li>
                        <li>Third, through difficult circumstances, trials, and suffering. "Your greatest ministry will almost always come out of your greatest sin, suffering, struggle, or weakness." God often uses our most painful experiences as preparation for our most powerful ministry.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>While pruning is painful, there are three comforting truths: Pruning is seasonal (it doesn't last forever), pruning is preparation (it has purpose), and pruning is not punishment (Jesus already took our punishment). Understanding these truths helps us endure pruning with hope rather than resentment.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>What areas of your life might God be pruning right now? How are you responding to this process?</li>
                        <li>Which of the three ways God prunes (Holy Spirit conviction, other people, difficult circumstances) have you experienced most prominently?</li>
                        <li>How have past "pruning seasons" in your life led to greater fruitfulness?</li>
                    </ol>

                <div class="prayer">
                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Heavenly Father, thank You for being the skilled Gardener who knows exactly what needs to be cut away in my life. I confess that I often resist Your pruning, clinging to comfort rather than embracing growth. Help me to trust Your perfect wisdom and timing. When conviction comes, give me the courage to respond. When others offer correction, give me humility to listen. When difficult circumstances arise, help me to look for Your purpose in them. Remind me that pruning is seasonal, purposeful, and motivated by love—not punishment. May I cooperate with Your work in my life so that I might bear more fruit for Your glory. In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Identify one area where you sense God may be pruning you right now. Write down how this pruning might be preparing you for greater fruitfulness. Then, take one concrete step to cooperate with God's work in this area—whether confessing sin, seeking reconciliation, adjusting priorities, or simply surrendering your resistance in prayer.</p>
