                    <p>Matthew 16:24-25 (ESV)</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Then Jesus told his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>After revealing what discipleship would cost Him, Jesus turns to what discipleship will cost us.</p>
                    <p>"If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me." These words are as challenging today as they were when Jesus first spoke them. They cut against the grain of our self-centered culture and our natural inclinations.</p>
                    <p>The first requirement Jesus mentions is to "deny himself." This is different from self-denial, which has its benefits and is practiced in various forms by many religions. Self-denial might involve giving up certain foods, limiting screen time, or practicing other forms of restraint. These can be helpful disciplines, but they're not what Jesus is talking about here.</p>
                    <p>Denying yourself goes deeper. It's not just saying no to certain things; it's saying no to your very self—your autonomy, your right to determine your own path, your claim to be the center of your own universe. It's a fundamental reorientation of your identity and allegiance.</p>
                    <p>Think about Peter's denial of Jesus. When confronted, Peter said, "I don't know the man." To deny yourself is to say about your old self, "I don't know that person anymore." It's to recognize that "I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me" (Galatians 2:20).</p>
                    <p>In practical terms, denying yourself means putting Christ first and others second in your life. It means moving from self-centeredness to Christ-centeredness. It means considering others' needs as more important than your own (Philippians 2:3-4).</p>
                    <p>This is countercultural in our "selfie" world. We live in an age obsessed with self—self-esteem, self-care, self-expression, self-fulfillment, self-help. The selfie itself symbolizes our tendency to put ourselves at the center and treat everything else as background.</p>
                    <p>But Jesus calls us to a different way. He calls us to what Tim Keller described as "self-forgetfulness"—a freedom from the constant need to think about ourselves, to defend ourselves, to promote ourselves. It's the ability to be so caught up in Christ and His mission that we think less about ourselves, not just think less of ourselves.</p>
                    <p>This doesn't mean we have no value or that self-care is wrong. Jesus affirms our worth when He says we're more valuable than many sparrows (Matthew 10:31) and when He gives His life for us. But He reorients our understanding of where our value comes from—not from our achievements, appearance, or acclaim, but from being loved by God.</p>
                    <p>Denying yourself doesn't diminish you; it fulfills you. Jesus promises that "whoever loses his life for my sake will find it." There's a paradox here: by giving up our claim to ourselves, we discover our true selves. By surrendering our lives to Christ, we find the life we were created for.</p>
                    <p>Today, consider what it means for you to deny yourself. What aspects of your autonomy do you need to surrender to Christ? Where are you still insisting on your own way rather than His? How might self-forgetfulness free you to love God and others more fully?</p>
                    <p>Denying ourselves is perhaps the most challenging aspect of discipleship. It goes against our natural human tendencies and the messages we receive from the world around us.</p>
                    <p>To deny ourselves means to say no to our natural desires, ambitions, and priorities when they conflict with God's will. It means recognizing that our lives are not our own to live as we please, but are meant to be lived for Him.</p>
                    <p>This doesn't mean we should hate ourselves or deny all pleasure. Rather, it means we must be willing to say no to things that would hinder our relationship with God or distract us from His purposes.</p>
                    <p>Denying ourselves often involves:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Letting go of control and submitting to God's authority</li>
                        <li>Saying no to sinful desires and patterns</li>
                        <li>Putting others' needs before our own</li>
                        <li>Letting go of pride and self-importance</li>
                        <li>Surrendering our plans to God's purposes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The good news is that when we deny ourselves, we don't lose our identity. Instead, we find our true selves in Christ. As we surrender our false selves, we discover the person God created us to be.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>What is the difference between self-denial and denying yourself? How have you experienced each in your life?</li>
                        <li>In what areas of your life do you find it most difficult to put Christ first and others second?</li>
                        <li>How have you experienced the paradox that losing your life for Christ's sake leads to finding true life?</li>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Heavenly Father, I confess that denying myself doesn't come naturally. My default is self-centeredness, self-protection, and self-promotion. Thank You for the example of Jesus, who "did not please himself" but gave Himself fully for us. Help me to say no to my old self and yes to the new identity You've given me in Christ. Teach me the freedom of self-forgetfulness—to be so caught up in loving You and others that I think less about myself. I surrender my autonomy, my rights, and my preferences to You today. In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Identify one specific area where you need to practice denying yourself this week. It might be surrendering a decision to God's wisdom rather than insisting on your own way, putting someone else's needs ahead of your own, or letting go of your right to be recognized or appreciated for something you've done.</p>
