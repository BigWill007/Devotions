                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>And he went up on the mountain and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him. And he appointed twelve (whom he also named apostles) so that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach.</p>
                    <p>— Mark 3:13-14 (ESV)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="devotional-text">
                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>Christianity isn't golf; it's baseball.</p>

                    <p>Think about it. Golf is something you can do by yourself. You're playing against yourself, managing the course on your own. But baseball? As soon as you say you play baseball, the immediate question is, "What team do you play for?" If you answered, "I don't play for a team," people would look at you strangely. You can't play baseball by yourself. You need others to throw to, to catch with, to practice with.</p>
                    <p>The same is true of following Jesus. You simply can't do it alone.</p>

                    <p>When Jesus began His ministry, one of His first actions was to gather people around Him. He didn't just teach crowds; He intentionally formed a community. He called twelve specific individuals to "be with him" and then to be "sent out." This pattern reveals something fundamental about discipleship: it happens in relationship with others.</p>

                    <p>Think about the disciples' experience. They learned from Jesus not just through His teaching, but by watching how He lived, how He prayed, how He responded to people in need, and even how He handled criticism. They saw His compassion in action. They witnessed His priorities. They observed His prayer life. And they did all this together, learning not just from Jesus but from each other's questions, mistakes, and insights.</p>

                    <p>This is why the early definition of discipleship is so powerful: "Open Bible, open life." At its core, discipleship is about opening God's Word together and opening our lives to one another. It's about transparency, vulnerability, and shared growth.</p>

                    <p>Many of us approach our faith primarily in terms of time and place: "I do my devotions at 7:30 AM in this chair" or "I attend church at 9:00 AM on Sundays." But what if we thought more in terms of relationships and responsibilities? What if we focused less on checking religious boxes and more on deepening our connections with fellow believers?</p>

                    <p>The truth is, "it takes a church to raise a Christian." We need others to encourage us when we're down, challenge us when we're complacent, and celebrate with us when we experience victory. We need others to help us see our blind spots and to remind us of God's faithfulness when we forget.</p>

                    <p>Today, consider the community God has placed around you. Are you trying to follow Jesus alone, or are you embracing the gift of spiritual family?</p>

                    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In what ways have you approached your faith as an individual sport rather than a team effort?</li>
                        <li>Who are the people in your life that help you follow Jesus more faithfully?</li>
                        <li>What makes it difficult for you to open your Bible and open your life with others?</li>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Heavenly Father, thank You for designing discipleship to happen in community. Forgive me for the times I've tried to follow You on my own strength and wisdom. Help me to embrace the gift of spiritual family You've placed around me. Give me courage to open Your Word and open my life with others. Show me how to invest deeply in relationships that help me grow as Your disciple. In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Identify one person in your life with whom you could practice "open Bible, open life" discipleship. Reach out to them today and suggest meeting regularly to read Scripture together and share honestly about your lives.</p>
