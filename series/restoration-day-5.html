                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>"He said to him a second time, 'Simon, son of John, do you love me?' He said to him, 'Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.' He said to him, 'Tend my sheep.'"</p>
                    <p>— John 21:16 (ESV)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="devotional-text">
                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>In Peter's restoration story, Jesus doesn't just forgive him—He reinstates him to leadership and service. Three times Jesus asks Peter about his love, corresponding to Peter's three denials. And three times Jesus responds with a commission: "Feed my lambs," "Tend my sheep," "Feed my sheep."</p>

                    <p>This reveals the fourth step in making a comeback: take responsibility for others. As the text explains, "Jesus is saying, 'Peter, I'm not just forgiving you. I'm putting you back in the game. I'm giving you responsibility again.'"</p>

                    <p>This might seem counterintuitive. We might think that after a major failure, we need a long period of sitting on the sidelines before we can be useful again. But Jesus shows us a different pattern. He quickly moves Peter from restoration to responsibility.</p>

                    <p>Why is this important? Because taking responsibility for others helps break the cycle of self-absorption that often accompanies failure. When we've failed, we tend to become intensely focused on ourselves—our shame, our reputation, our future. By calling us to serve others, Jesus redirects our attention outward.</p>

                    <p>There's also something healing about being trusted again. When Jesus says, "Tend my sheep," He's essentially saying, "I still trust you with what's precious to me." This vote of confidence from Christ Himself must have been profoundly healing for Peter.</p>

                    <p>The text points out that "Jesus doesn't call Peter to be responsible for himself. He calls him to be responsible for others." This is significant. Self-improvement projects often keep us focused inward, but Jesus calls us to look outward—to feed and tend His flock.</p>

                    <p>This doesn't mean we should rush back into the exact same role or position after a failure, especially if trust needs to be rebuilt. But it does mean that service to others should be part of our restoration process, not something that happens only after we feel completely healed.</p>

                    <p>The text offers this powerful insight: "The way to stop drowning in your failure is to start swimming in your calling." When we focus on fulfilling our God-given purpose and serving others, we find freedom from the paralyzing effects of past failures.</p>

                    <p>Jesus's reinstatement of Peter also reminds us that our failures don't disqualify us from being used by God. In fact, they might actually prepare us for more effective ministry. A restored Peter would be more compassionate toward others' failures, more dependent on God's strength rather than his own, and more appreciative of grace than he was before.</p>

                            <li>In what ways might your failures actually equip you to minister more effectively to others?</li>

                        <h3>Prayer</h3>
                        <p>Lord Jesus, thank You for not only forgiving Peter but reinstating him to service. Thank You for doing the same for me. Forgive me for the times I've used my failures as an excuse to withdraw from responsibility and service. Help me to see that taking responsibility for others is part of my healing process, not something that comes only after I'm fully restored. Show me specific ways I can feed and tend Your sheep today. Use my failures and restoration to make me more effective in serving others. Thank You that my past doesn't disqualify me from being used by You. In Your name I pray, Amen.</p>

                        <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                        <p>Identify one specific way you can "feed" or "tend" someone in your sphere of influence this week. It might be offering encouragement, practical help, spiritual guidance, or simply a listening ear. Make a concrete plan to follow through, and as you serve, reflect on how this outward focus affects your perspective on your own failures.</p>
