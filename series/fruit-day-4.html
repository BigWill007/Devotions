                <div class="scripture">
                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.</p>
                    <p>— John 15:4-5 (ESV)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="devotional-text">
                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>The word "abide" appears repeatedly throughout John 15, emphasizing its central importance. To abide means to remain, to stay connected, to dwell with consistency. It's not a one-time decision but an ongoing relationship. This connection to Christ is essential for fruitfulness.</p>
                    <p>Jesus makes this abundantly clear with His stark declaration: "Apart from me you can do nothing." This statement challenges our independent spirit and self-sufficiency. We may accomplish many things in our own strength—build careers, maintain relationships, achieve goals—but Jesus is speaking of spiritual fruit that has eternal significance.</p>
                    <p>Without connection to Him, even our most impressive achievements lack spiritual vitality.</p>
                    <p>It's important to see yourself as a branch, not the vine. "The most unhappy people I know are the people who are trying to satisfy themselves with themselves." When we attempt to be self-sufficient, drawing life from our own resources, we eventually run dry. Branches were never designed to generate their own life; they were designed to receive and channel life from the vine.</p>
                    <p>This understanding should bring both humility and relief. Humility, because we recognize our complete dependence on Christ. Relief, because the pressure isn't on us to generate spiritual life through our own efforts. Our primary responsibility is to remain connected—to abide.</p>
                    <p>What does abiding look like practically? It includes regular time in God's Word, not as a religious duty but as nourishment for our souls. It involves ongoing conversation with God through prayer. It means walking in obedience to Christ's commands, not to earn His love but to remain in it (John 15:10). And it means staying connected to His body, the church, where His life flows through community.</p>
                    <p>The beautiful promise is that when we abide, fruit happens naturally. Just as a healthy branch connected to a healthy vine naturally produces grapes, a believer abiding in Christ naturally produces spiritual fruit. The focus shifts from striving to produce fruit to simply maintaining connection with the Source.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In what areas of your life are you trying to bear fruit "apart from" Christ?</li>
                        <li>What practical habits help you abide in Christ? Which of these needs strengthening?</li>
                        <li>How does seeing yourself as a branch (rather than the vine) change your approach to spiritual growth?</li>

                <div class="prayer">
                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Lord Jesus, thank You for being my vine—the source of all spiritual life and fruitfulness. Forgive me for the times I've tried to produce fruit through my own efforts or sought satisfaction in my own resources. I acknowledge my complete dependence on You. Help me to abide in You daily through Your Word, prayer, obedience, and community. Remove any obstacles that hinder our connection. Teach me what it means to rest in You even as I work for You. May my life demonstrate the truth that apart from You I can do nothing, but connected to You, much fruit is possible. In Your name I pray, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Set aside 15 minutes today for an "abiding audit." Evaluate your current practices for staying connected to Christ (Bible reading, prayer, obedience, community). For each one, note what's working well and what needs adjustment. Choose one specific action to strengthen your abiding practice, and implement it today.</p>
