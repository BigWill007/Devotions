                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>These things I command you, so that you will love one another.</p>
                    <p>— John 15:17 (ESV)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="devotional-text">
                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>It's significant that Jesus concludes His teaching about the vine and branches with a command about community: "love one another." This reminds us that fruitfulness isn't just an individual pursuit—it happens in the context of relationships with other believers.</p>
                    <p>Throughout John 15, Jesus uses plural language when addressing the disciples. He doesn't say, "You (singular) are a branch"; He says, "You (plural) are the branches." While each of us has a personal connection to Christ, we're also part of a community of branches drawing life from the same vine.</p>
                    <p>This communal aspect of fruitfulness appears in several ways. First, many aspects of spiritual fruit, like love, patience, and kindness, can only be fully expressed in relationships with others. We don't develop these qualities in isolation.</p>
                    <p>Second, we need each other for pruning and growth. As we've seen, God often uses other believers to help shape us through encouragement, example, and sometimes loving confrontation. Proverbs 27:17 reminds us that "iron sharpens iron, and one person sharpens another."</p>
                    <p>Third, some types of fruit require collaboration. Think about the early church in Acts— their witness was powerful partly because of their unity and shared life. When believers pool their gifts, resources, and efforts, they can often accomplish more for God's kingdom than they could individually.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, community provides accountability for bearing fruit. When we're connected to other believers who know us well, they can help us recognize areas where we're not bearing fruit and encourage us toward greater fruitfulness.</p>
                    <p>Jesus's command to "love one another" isn't just a nice sentiment to conclude His teaching. It's essential to the fruitfulness He's been describing throughout the passage. Love is both the environment in which fruit grows and a primary fruit itself.</p>
                    <p>This love isn't based on natural affinity or shared interests. It's a supernatural love that flows from our connection to Christ. Jesus says earlier in the chapter, "As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love" (John 15:9). We love others out of the overflow of Christ's love for us.</p>
                    <p>Today, consider how your connection to the community of believers affects your fruitfulness. Are you trying to bear fruit in isolation, or are you drawing strength from your relationships with other Christians? Are you contributing to an environment of love where others can grow and bear fruit as well?</p>

                        <li>In what ways might isolation or disconnection from Christian community be hindering your fruitfulness?</li>

                <div class="prayer">
                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Heavenly Father, thank You for the gift of community. I recognize that You've designed me to bear fruit not in isolation but in connection with other believers. Forgive me for the times I've tried to go it alone or have failed to love my brothers and sisters as You've commanded. Help me to create and nurture relationships where mutual growth can happen. Show me how to love others with the same love You've shown me. Use me to encourage fruitfulness in those around me, even as they help me bear more fruit. May our community be marked by the kind of supernatural love that draws others to You. In Jesus's name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Reach out to one or two believers who help you bear spiritual fruit. Thank them specifically for how they've encouraged your growth. Then, identify one person in your faith community who might need encouragement in their spiritual journey. Take a concrete step to support their fruitfulness this week through prayer, conversation, or practical help.</p>
