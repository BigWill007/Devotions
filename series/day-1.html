                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>Matthew 4:12-17 (ESV)</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee. And leaving Nazareth he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali, so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: 
                        "The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, 
                        the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles— 
                        the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light, 
                        and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death, 
                        on them a light has dawned."
                        From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
                    </blockquote>

                <div class="devotional-text">
                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>Jesus' arrival on the scene was marked by a significant shift. When John the Baptist was arrested, Jesus withdrew to Galilee, fulfilling ancient prophecy. The prophet Isaiah had foretold of a great light dawning in a region that was in darkness.</p>
                    <p>This region—Galilee—was a place of darkness in several ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Geographically, it was a remote area, far from the religious center of Jerusalem</li>
                        <li>Spiritually, it was a place where people were living in moral and spiritual darkness</li>
                        <li>Culturally, it was considered a backwater, a place of little importance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>But Jesus chose to bring His light to this place. He didn't go to the centers of power or influence. He went to the margins, to the forgotten places, to show that His light was for everyone.</p>
                    <p>Notice what Jesus did when He arrived: He began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." This was a declaration that the light had come, and with it came a call to change. The darkness was being dispelled, and people needed to respond.</p>
                    <p>Jesus' arrival marked a turning point in history. The kingdom of heaven was no longer a distant promise—it was present in Him. And wherever He went, the light of God's presence and power was breaking through.</p>
                    <p>Think about your own life. Where do you need Jesus' light to shine? What areas of darkness—spiritual, emotional, or relational—need His presence? Just as Jesus brought light to Galilee, He wants to bring His light to every dark corner of your life.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>What does it mean to you personally to "follow Jesus" in your daily life?</li>
                        <li>What might Jesus be calling you to leave behind to follow Him more fully?</li>
                        <li>How has Jesus met you in the ordinary moments of your life?</li>

                <div class="prayer">
                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Heavenly Father, thank You for meeting me right where I am. Thank You that Jesus calls ordinary people like me to follow Him. Give me the courage to respond immediately when You call. Help me to recognize the things I need to leave behind to follow You more faithfully. I want to be Your disciple—not just in name, but in how I live each day. Use my unique experiences, skills, and personality for Your kingdom purposes. In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Identify one specific area of your life where you need to respond to Jesus' call to follow Him. It might be a habit you need to change, a relationship that needs attention, or a ministry opportunity you've been hesitating to pursue. Write down your "first step" of obedience and commit to taking it today.</p>
