                    <p>"Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together."</p>

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>After Peter's devastating failure, we might expect him to isolate himself in shame. Yet in John 21, we find him surrounded by his fellow disciples. The first step if you're going to make a comeback is to engage your Christian community.</p>
                    <p>This wasn't just a casual gathering. When we fill in the timeline, we see that Peter showed up to the community group on Sunday morning after Jesus's resurrection, despite his shame and confusion. He continued to do life with his Christian brothers even when every instinct might have told him to withdraw.</p>
                    <p>The temptation after a failure is to withdraw from community. And I know why we do this—withdrawal feels like a retreat to safety, but it's actually a retreat from safety. This insight is profound. When we fail, our natural response is often to hide, to pull away from the very people who could help us process our failure and find a path forward.</p>
                    <p>We see this contrast play out dramatically in the lives of two disciples who failed Jesus: Peter and Judas. Both betrayed their Lord in significant ways. But while Peter remained connected to community, Judas isolated himself and ultimately took his own life. Judas withdrew into his own destruction.</p>
                    <p>This pattern continues today. When we experience failure—whether it's a moral failure, a relational breakdown, or a professional setback—the pull to withdraw is strong. We might think, "I need some space" or "I need to figure this out on my own first." But often, these are just sophisticated ways of hiding in shame.</p>
                    <p>If you're doing this, stop doing this. Don't do this. You at least need to show up and look sad so that somebody asks you what's going on. While this might sound humorous, it contains deep wisdom. Sometimes the simple act of showing up, even when we don't feel like it, creates the opportunity for healing to begin.</p>
                    <p>Community provides perspective we can't gain on our own. It offers accountability when we're tempted to rationalize our failures. It extends grace when we can't forgive ourselves. And it reminds us that we're not alone in our struggles—that others have failed too and found their way back through Christ.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>After experiencing failure, do you tend to withdraw from or lean into community? Why?</li>
                        <li>What makes it difficult for you to be vulnerable about your failures with other believers?</li>
                        <li>Is there a situation right now where you're withdrawing from community? What would it look like to "show up and look sad" in that context?</li>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Heavenly Father, thank You for the gift of Christian community. Forgive me for the times I've withdrawn in shame rather than leaning into the support You've provided through Your people. Help me to see that isolation after failure is not protection but danger. Give me the courage to show up, even when I feel unworthy or afraid. Thank You for fellow believers who can speak truth and grace into my life when I can't see clearly. Help me to be that kind of friend to others as well. In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Identify one area where you might be withdrawing from community due to shame, disappointment, or failure. Make a specific commitment to "show up" this week— whether that's attending a church service, reaching out to a trusted friend, or being honest in your community group. Write down what you'll do and when you'll do it.</p>
