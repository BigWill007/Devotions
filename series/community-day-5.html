                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>Mark 3:16-19 (ESV)</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter); James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder); Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.

                <div class="devotional-text">
                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>Not everyone who makes a significant impact is well-known.</p>
                    <p>When we read the list of Jesus's twelve disciples, something striking emerges: we know very little about at least seven of them. Beyond their names, the Bible gives us minimal information about Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot.</p>
                    <p>These men spent three years with Jesus. They witnessed His miracles, heard His teaching, saw Him die, and encountered Him after His resurrection. They were commissioned to take the gospel to the world. Yet the Bible tells us almost nothing about their individual contributions.</p>
                    <p>This should be deeply encouraging to those of us who will never have our names in lights. The kingdom of God advances through countless faithful individuals whose names aren't recorded in history books but are written in the Lamb's book of life.</p>
                    <p>Some of you may feel completely unknown. You don't have a large social media following. You're not on stage. You're not in leadership. You try to serve faithfully, but you sometimes wonder if anyone notices or if what you're doing even matters.</p>
                    <p>Take heart. The seven disciples we know little about were no less disciples than Peter, James, and John. They were no less chosen, no less loved, no less important to Jesus's mission. Their obscurity in Scripture doesn't reflect their value to Jesus or their impact on the early church.</p>
                    <p>In fact, tradition suggests that these "unknown" disciples went on to accomplish remarkable things. According to early church writings, Andrew evangelized in Greece, Thomas took the gospel to India, Bartholomew to Armenia, and so on. Though Scripture doesn't detail their ministries, their faithfulness helped spread Christianity throughout the ancient world.</p>
                    <p>This reminds us that God's economy of significance is different from the world's. The world values visibility, platform, influence, and recognition. But God values faithfulness, obedience, and character—qualities that often develop best away from the spotlight.</p>
                    <p>Jesus Himself said, "The last will be first, and the first will be last" (Matthew 20:16). He taught that those who humble themselves will be exalted, while those who exalt themselves will be humbled (Luke 14:11). The kingdom of God often operates in reverse of our natural expectations.</p>
                    <p>So if you feel unknown or unrecognized, remember that you're in good company. Remember that God sees every act of service, every prayer, every sacrifice made in secret. And remember that one day, as Andy Davis suggests, we may spend eternity celebrating the advancement of God's mission by hearing the stories of every individual believer—perhaps spending the most time on those we knew the least about.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In what ways do you struggle with the desire to be known, recognized, or appreciated?</li>
                        <li>How does the example of the "unknown disciples" encourage you in your current season of life and ministry?</li>
                        <li>What acts of faithful service might God be calling you to, regardless of whether anyone else notices?</li>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Heavenly Father, thank You for the example of the disciples whose names we know but whose stories remain largely untold. Thank You for reminding me that significance in Your kingdom isn't measured by recognition or platform. Help me to find contentment in being known by You rather than being known by others. Give me the courage to serve faithfully even when no one seems to notice. Remind me that You see every act of obedience, every sacrifice, every moment of faithfulness. May I find joy in obscurity, knowing that one day all that is hidden will be revealed. In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>

                    <p>Identify one "behind-the-scenes" act of service you could do this week with no expectation of recognition or thanks. Commit to doing it as an offering to God alone.</p>
