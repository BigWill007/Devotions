                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>Matthew 16:13-16 (ESV)</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?" And they said, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
                        
                        He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Simon Peter replied, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
                    </blockquote>

                <div class="devotional-text">
                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>The most important question you'll ever answer is the one Jesus asked His disciples: "Who do you say that I am?"</p>
                    <p>In Matthew 16, Jesus takes His disciples to Caesarea Philippi, about 25 miles north of Jerusalem. This wasn't a casual field trip. Caesarea Philippi was known for its pagan worship and moral corruption. Against this backdrop of false gods and misplaced devotion, Jesus asks the question that cuts to the heart of discipleship.</p>
                    <p>First, He asks what others are saying about Him. The disciples report the popular opinions: "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets." These weren't negative assessments. In fact, they were complimentary. John the Baptist was a powerful prophet. Elijah was expected to return before the Messiah. Jeremiah was deeply respected. But these answers, while respectful, missed the mark.</p>
                    <p>Then Jesus makes it personal: "But who do you say that I am?" He moves from public opinion to personal confession. From what "they" say to what "you" say. From general respect to specific relationship.</p>
                    <p>Peter's answer is remarkable: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." In that moment, Peter doesn't just identify Jesus's role (the Christ, the Messiah) but His very nature (the Son of the living God). This isn't just acknowledging Jesus as a good teacher or a powerful prophet. This is recognizing Him as divine, as God in the flesh, as the promised Deliverer.</p>
                    <p>Jesus affirms that this revelation didn't come from human wisdom but from divine disclosure: "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."</p>
                    <p>This exchange reveals something fundamental about discipleship: it begins with a right understanding of who Jesus is. Not just a good example to follow or a wise teacher to learn from, but the Christ, the Son of the living God. The One worthy of our complete devotion and absolute allegiance.</p>
                    <p>Discipleship flows from this confession. Once we recognize who Jesus truly is, we can't help but follow Him. Once we acknowledge Him as Lord, we must submit to His leadership. Once we confess Him as God's Son, we must orient our lives around His teaching.</p>
                    <p>This is why we define discipleship as "following Jesus and helping others find and follow Jesus." It starts with our own recognition of Jesus as the Christ, which leads to our following Him. And it continues as we help others come to the same life-changing realization.</p>
                    <p>Today, consider your own answer to Jesus's question. Who do you say that He is? Not just intellectually, but practically. Does your life reflect a belief that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God? Are you following Him as Lord, or merely admiring Him from a distance?</p>
                    <p>Jesus' call to discipleship is clear and unequivocal. He doesn't say "If you want to be my fan" or "If you want to be my casual follower." He says, "If anyone would come after me." This is a call to radical commitment, not casual association.</p>
                    <p>The three actions Jesus describes—denying self, taking up the cross, and following—are not optional extras for super-Christians. They are essential components of basic discipleship. Anyone who wants to follow Jesus must be willing to do these things.</p>
                    <p>Denying ourselves means recognizing that our natural desires and ambitions must be submitted to God's will. It's not about self-hatred, but about self-surrender. It's about saying no to our fleshly desires when they conflict with God's purposes.</p>
                    <p>Taking up our cross is about embracing the challenges and difficulties that come with following Jesus. In Jesus' day, carrying a cross meant facing certain death. For us, it means being willing to face opposition, make sacrifices, and endure hardships for His sake.</p>
                    <p>Following Jesus isn't about adding Him to our lives; it's about making Him the central focus of our lives. It means reordering our priorities, changing our values, and living in a way that reflects His kingdom priorities rather than the world's.</p>
                    <p>This call to discipleship is not just for a select few, but for anyone who would come after Jesus. It's not a special track for the super-spiritual, but the basic pathway for all who would follow Him.</p>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Lord Jesus, I confess that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. Thank You for revealing Yourself to me through Your Word and Your Spirit. Forgive me for the times I've treated You as less than who You truly are—when I've followed my own wisdom instead of Your teaching, sought my own glory instead of Yours, or lived as if You were just a part of my life rather than my Lord. Help me to live in light of who You are, following You faithfully and helping others find and follow You too. In Your name I pray, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Identify one area of your life where you need to more fully acknowledge Jesus as Lord. Write down a specific step you can take today to bring that area under His leadership. Then identify one person in your life who needs to know who Jesus truly is, and pray for an opportunity to share with them.</p>
