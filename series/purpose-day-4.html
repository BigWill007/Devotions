                    <p>And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction. The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>In today's passage, we see an important transition. Jesus calls "his twelve disciples" and gives them authority, but in the very next verse, they are referred to as "apostles." This shift in terminology is significant.
                    The word "disciple" means a learner or follower—someone who is being taught. The word "apostle," on the other hand, means "one who is sent out." As the teaching points out, this illustrates an important principle: "God saves you to send you."
                    This is the pattern of Christian growth. We come to faith in Christ and begin as disciples, learning from Jesus and being transformed by His teaching. This discipleship process is lifelong—we never graduate from being learners of Christ. But at some point, Jesus also sends us out as His representatives, His "apostles" in a broader sense.
                    The message emphasizes that Christians are not just "thrown into the world to do our best." Rather, we are intentionally sent by Jesus with a specific purpose. Our presence in our workplaces, neighborhoods, and social circles is not accidental or random—it's missional. We are ambassadors of Christ, representing Him in these spaces.
                    It's worth noting that after Jesus sends out the twelve apostles in Matthew 10, Luke's gospel tells us that He later sends out seventy-two others (Luke 10:1-24). The teaching suggests that while the twelve might be seen as "professionals," these seventy-two could be viewed as "volunteers." This reminds us that being sent by Jesus isn't just for those in full-time ministry—it's for every follower of Christ.
                    This understanding transforms how we view our daily lives. Your job isn't just a way to earn a living; it's a mission field where God has strategically placed you. Your neighborhood isn't just where you happen to live; it's a community where God has sent you to be salt and light. Your children's school, your gym, your favorite coffee shop— these are all places where you've been sent with purpose.
                    Today, embrace your identity as one who is both learning from Jesus (disciple) and sent by Jesus (apostle). Ask Him to help you see the purpose behind your placement in every context of your life.</p>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Lord Jesus, thank You for not only saving me but also sending me. Help me to embrace my identity as both Your disciple and Your ambassador. Open my eyes to see the purpose behind where You've placed me—in my workplace, my neighborhood, my relationships. Give me courage to represent You faithfully in these contexts. Forgive me for the times I've viewed my daily life as disconnected from Your mission. Help me to see that everything I do can be infused with kingdom purpose. Use me as Your sent one today. In Your name I pray, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Choose one context in your life (workplace, neighborhood, etc.) and write down three specific ways you can intentionally represent Christ there this week. Ask God to help you see this area through the lens of being "sent" rather than just "present."</p>
