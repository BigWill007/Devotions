                    <p>"And after saying this he said to him, 'Follow me.'"</p>
                    <p>— John 21:19b (ESV)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="devotional-text">
                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>After reinstating Peter to leadership, Jesus gives him a simple but profound command: "Follow me." This is the fifth step in making a comeback: follow Jesus daily. It's significant that Jesus doesn't say, "Now that you've been restored, go lead my church" or "Go change the world." He says, "Follow me."</p>

                    <p>This reminds us that Christian leadership and service flow from followership. Before Peter can effectively feed and tend Christ's sheep, he must recommit to following the Good Shepherd himself. The same is true for us. Our primary calling is not to lead or serve, but to follow Jesus. Everything else flows from that fundamental relationship.</p>

                    <p>The text points out that this isn't the first time Jesus has called Peter to follow Him. Three years earlier, Jesus had approached Peter at his fishing boat with the same invitation: "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men" (Matthew 4:19). Now, after Peter's failure and restoration, Jesus renews this call.</p>

                    <p>This renewal is important because failure often makes us question our calling. We might think, "I've disqualified myself. Surely God can't use me now." But Jesus shows us that while sin has consequences, it doesn't necessarily change God's call on our lives. The invitation to follow remains open.</p>

                    <p>Following Jesus is a daily commitment. It's not a one-time decision but an ongoing choice to align our lives with His direction. As the text explains, "Following Jesus is a daily decision to deny yourself, take up your cross, and follow Him." Each day presents new opportunities to either follow our own way or follow Jesus.</p>

                    <p>What does following Jesus look like practically? It means submitting to His authority in every area of life. It means studying His words and example in Scripture and seeking to apply them. It means listening for His guidance through prayer and the Holy Spirit. And it means walking in obedience, even when the path is difficult.</p>

                    <p>The text reminds us that "following Jesus is not a means to an end. It is the end." We don't follow Jesus primarily to achieve success, avoid failure, or accomplish great things. We follow Him because He is worthy of our devotion and because relationship with Him is the ultimate purpose of our lives.</p>

                    <p>For Peter, this renewed call to follow would lead to places he didn't expect. Jesus goes on to tell him that when he is old, he will stretch out his hands and be led where he does not want to go—a reference to Peter's eventual martyrdom. Following Jesus doesn't guarantee an easy path, but it does promise a meaningful one.</p>

                    <p>As you continue your comeback journey, remember that restoration isn't complete until it leads to renewed followership. Whatever your failure has been, Jesus is extending the same invitation He gave to Peter: "Follow me."</p>

                            <li>In what areas of your life do you find it most difficult to follow Jesus rather than your own way?</li>
                            <li>How has failure affected your sense of calling or purpose? Do you need to hear Jesus renewing His call to follow Him?</li>
                            <li>What practical steps can you take to follow Jesus more faithfully in your daily life?</li>

                        <h3>Prayer</h3>
                        <p>Lord Jesus, thank You for Your renewed call to follow You, even after I've failed. I confess that I sometimes try to serve You without truly following You, or I question whether You can still use me because of my failures. Help me to hear Your invitation afresh today: "Follow me." Give me the courage and commitment to follow You daily—to deny myself, take up my cross, and walk in Your footsteps. Thank You that following You isn't just a means to some other end, but the very purpose of my life. Lead me where You want me to go, even when the path is difficult. In Your name I pray, Amen.</p>
