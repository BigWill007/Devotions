                    <blockquote>
                        And looking about at those who sat around him, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother."

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>Discipleship isn't a program; it's a lifestyle.</p>
                    <p>As we conclude our week-long journey exploring discipleship in community, let's focus on practical ways to live out what we've learned. Jesus's statement in today's passage reminds us that true family is formed around obedience to God. Discipleship happens as we do God's will together.</p>
                    <p>So what does this look like in everyday life?</p>

                    <p>First, discipleship happens in ordinary moments. Jesus didn't disciple His followers through formal classes or structured programs (though these can be helpful). He invited them into His daily life—eating together, walking together, ministering together, resting together. They learned by watching Him navigate real-life situations.</p>
                    <p>We can follow this pattern by inviting others into our everyday routines. A young mom might invite single women to spend time in her home, giving them a window into family life while receiving practical help. Someone passionate about fitness might invite others to work out together, creating natural opportunities for spiritual conversations. A skilled professional might mentor younger people in their field while intentionally incorporating biblical principles.</p>

                    <p>Second, discipleship requires intentionality. While it happens in ordinary moments, it doesn't happen by accident. Jesus was strategic about who He invested in and what He taught them. He had a clear purpose: to prepare them to carry on His mission after He returned to the Father.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, we need to be intentional about our discipleship relationships. This means thinking about who God has placed in our lives, what they need to grow, and how we can help them take their next step with Jesus. It means planning times to open the Bible together and creating environments where people feel safe to open their lives.</p>

                    <p>Third, discipleship flows from our own life stage and lifestyle. You don't need to create artificial environments for discipleship; you can minister out of who you already are and what you already do. If you love cooking, invite people over for meals with meaningful conversation. If you enjoy outdoor activities, organize hikes or fishing trips where you can talk about life and faith. If you're skilled in a particular area, teach others while weaving in spiritual truths.</p>

                    <p>Finally, discipleship is a two-way street. We never outgrow our need to be discipled by others, even as we disciple others. The Christian life is one of continuous growth, and we all need people further along in their journey to guide us, even as we guide others who are newer in faith.</p>

                    <p>As we close this devotional, remember the simple definition we started with: "Open Bible, open life." At its core, discipleship is about opening God's Word together and opening our lives to one another. It's about creating spaces where we can be honest about our struggles, celebrate our victories, ask our questions, and encourage one another toward greater Christlikeness.</p>
                    <p>You don't need special training or a formal position to disciple others. You simply need a willingness to share your life and God's Word with those around you. As you do, you'll discover the joy of seeing others grow in their relationship with Jesus—and you'll find yourself growing too.</p>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Heavenly Father, thank You for the example of Jesus, who discipled others through everyday life with extraordinary intentionality. Help me to see the discipleship opportunities in my normal routines and relationships. Give me courage to invite others into my life and to be vulnerable about my own journey. Show me who You want me to invest in, and give me wisdom to know how to help them grow. Thank You for the people who have discipled me along the way. May I pass on to others what has been entrusted to me. Help me to be faithful in following Jesus and helping others find and follow Jesus. In His name I pray, Amen.</p>

Next to each name, write down one practical way you could invite them into your life or create space for "open Bible, open life" conversation. Commit to taking at least one action step this week.</p>
