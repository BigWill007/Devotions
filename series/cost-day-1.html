                    <blockquote>
                        Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.

                    <p>There's something beautiful about a "gospel goodbye."</p>
                    <p>When we see someone we love leave for the sake of the gospel—whether it's to plant a church, launch a campus, or serve as a missionary—there's a mixture of emotions. There's sadness because we'll miss them. There's anxiety because we know they'll face challenges. But there's also deep joy because we know they're participating in something greater than themselves.</p>
                    <p>This is what it means to be a sending church. It's not just about gathering people; it's about mobilizing them. It's not just about growing larger; it's about sending farther. The mission isn't just to build a congregation but to make and mobilize disciples who will take the gospel to neighborhoods and nations alike.</p>
                    <p>Jesus's final words to His disciples in Matthew 28 weren't "Come and see" but "Go and tell." The Great Commission isn't a suggestion for the spiritually elite; it's a command for every follower of Christ. We are all called to participate in this mission, whether by going ourselves or by supporting those who go.</p>
                    <p>Think about the early church in Acts. They didn't cling to their comfort or prioritize their preferences. When persecution scattered them, they "went everywhere preaching the word" (Acts 8:4). Their scattering became God's sending. Their pain became God's purpose. Their goodbye became God's gospel opportunity.</p>
                    <p>The same is true today. Every time we say goodbye to someone leaving for the sake of the gospel, we're participating in God's global mission. Every time we support a missionary, encourage a church planter, or pray for a campus launch, we're extending the reach of the gospel beyond our immediate circle.</p>
                    <p>But here's the challenge: Are we willing to be sent? Are we willing to send? Are we holding our comfort, our community, and our plans with open hands, ready to go wherever God calls us? Are we willing to support others who are called to go, even when it means saying difficult goodbyes?</p>
                    <p>The beautiful paradox of the kingdom is that our willingness to scatter actually strengthens the church. Our willingness to say goodbye actually advances the gospel. Our willingness to send actually expands our spiritual family across the globe.</p>
                    <p>Today, consider how you might be part of this sending mission. It might mean being willing to go yourself—across the street or across the ocean. It might mean generously supporting those who are going. It might mean fervently praying for those who have been sent. Whatever your role, embrace the privilege of participating in God's global mission of making disciples of all nations.</p>
                    <p>Jesus' words in Matthew 16 are a wake-up call to the true cost of following Him. This isn't about a casual relationship or a comfortable faith journey. It's about a radical commitment that involves denying ourselves, taking up our cross, and following Him.</p>
                    <p>Denying ourselves means saying no to our natural desires, ambitions, and priorities when they conflict with God's will. It means recognizing that our lives are not our own to live as we please, but are meant to be lived for Him.</p>
                    <p>Taking up our cross is a powerful image. In Jesus' day, carrying a cross meant facing certain death. For us, it means embracing the difficulties and challenges that come with following Jesus. It means being willing to face opposition, make sacrifices, and endure hardships for His sake.</p>
                    <p>Following Jesus isn't about adding Him to our lives; it's about making Him the central focus of our lives. It means reordering our priorities, changing our values, and living in a way that reflects His kingdom priorities rather than the world's.</p>
                    <p>Jesus makes it clear: the cost of following Him is high. We must be willing to lose our lives in order to find them. This doesn't mean physical death, but rather dying to our old way of living and being reborn into a new way of life centered on Him.</p>
                    <p>But Jesus also promises that what we gain is far greater than what we lose. He asks, "What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul?" The answer is clear: nothing. The treasures of this world cannot compare to the eternal life and purpose we find in Christ.</p>
