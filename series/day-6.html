                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>Matthew 4:18-19 (ESV)</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
                    </blockquote>

                <div class="devotional-text">
                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>When Jesus called His first disciples, He didn't ask them to abandon their identities and skills. Instead, He promised to repurpose who they already were: "I will make you fishers of men."</p>
                    <p>This is a profound insight into how Jesus works in our lives. He doesn't typically erase our personalities, experiences, and abilities when we follow Him. Rather, He redirects them toward His kingdom purposes.</p>
                    <p>These men were fishermen. That's what they knew. That's what they were good at. Jesus didn't say, "Follow me, and I'll make you something completely different." He said, "Follow me, and I'll take what you already are and redirect it for a greater purpose."</p>
                    <p>Think about what these fishermen knew about their trade:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They understood patience—sometimes you fish all night and catch nothing.</li>
                        <li>They knew about persistence—you don't give up after one empty net.</li>
                        <li>They were familiar with discernment—knowing where to cast the net and when.</li>
                        <li>They recognized the importance of teamwork—fishing was often a communal activity.</li>
                        <li>They had learned to navigate storms and changing conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All these skills and experiences would serve them well in their new mission of reaching people with the good news of Jesus. What looked like ordinary work experience became preparation for extraordinary kingdom work.</p>
                    <p>The same is true for us. Your background, skills, interests, and even your struggles can be repurposed by Jesus for His kingdom. The teacher becomes someone who helps others understand God's truth. The business person becomes someone who models integrity in the marketplace and uses resources for God's purposes. The parent becomes someone who disciples the next generation.</p>
                    <p>Even our weaknesses and failures can be repurposed. The person who has struggled with addiction can minister with unique compassion to others facing similar battles. The one who has experienced deep grief can comfort others with the comfort they've received from God.</p>
                    <p>This is the beauty of following Jesus—nothing is wasted. He takes the raw materials of our lives—our personalities, experiences, skills, relationships, and even our wounds— and repurposes them for His glory and the good of others.</p>
                    <p>But notice that Jesus said, "I will make you fishers of men." The transformation doesn't happen instantly. It's a process. Just as these men had learned fishing over years of practice, they would learn this new kind of fishing through time spent with Jesus, watching Him, listening to Him, and practicing what He taught.</p>
                    <p>The same is true for us. Becoming effective in serving God's kingdom is a lifelong learning process. It involves spending time with Jesus, studying His Word, being shaped by His Spirit, and stepping out in faith to put what we're learning into practice.</p>
                    <p>What might Jesus want to repurpose in your life? What skills, experiences, or relationships do you have that could be redirected toward His kingdom purposes?</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>What specific skills, experiences, or relationships do you have that Jesus might want to repurpose for His kingdom?</li>
                        <li>How have you seen God already using aspects of your background or personality in ways you might not have expected?</li>
                        <li>What areas of your life are you still holding back from God's repurposing work?</li>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Lord Jesus, thank You for not asking me to become someone else to follow You, but for wanting to repurpose who I already am for Your kingdom. Help me to see the ways You've been preparing me through my experiences, skills, and relationships. Show me how You want to redirect these things for Your purposes. I surrender all that I am and all that I have to You. Use me as You see fit in Your kingdom work. In Your name I pray, Amen.</p>
