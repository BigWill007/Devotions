                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>"When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?' He said to him, 'Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.'"</p>
                    <p>— John 21:15 (ESV)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="devotional-text">
                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>In this powerful exchange between Jesus and Peter, something profound is happening that isn't immediately obvious in our English translations. Jesus asks Peter, "Do you agape me?" using the Greek word for the highest form of love—unending, unbreaking, covenantal devotion. Peter, however, responds with a different word: "Yes, Lord; you know that I fileo you," using the Greek term for friendship love.</p>
                    <p>This might seem like a minor linguistic detail, but it reveals a significant shift in Peter's approach. At the Last Supper, Peter had boldly declared, "I will lay down my life for you," radically overstating his devotion to Christ. Now, after his failure, Peter is choosing to see himself with "more sober judgment." He's being honest about where he's at.</p>
                    <p>The second crucial step in making a comeback: Stop lying. Start being honest. This honesty must begin with ourselves. It's hard to be honest with yourself... People don't like feeling terrible about themselves. It's much more pleasant to maintain illusions about our character and capabilities than to confront our limitations and failures.</p>
                    <p>But there's a profound insight here: To the extent you lie to yourself, you leave reality. Truth is simply that which corresponds to reality. When we're not honest with ourselves, we're living in an alternate universe—a place that isn't real. This dishonesty inevitably extends to how we present ourselves to others and to God.</p>
                    <p>Once you decide you like fake me better, you start to think, "I bet other people are going to like fake me better too." So fake you shows up at the office, on dates, at coffee with friends. But the problem is that fake you can't have real relationships. Meanwhile, real you is still here, unaccepted and unaffirmed... unknown and growing more desperate to be accepted.</p>
                    <p>Most seriously, we lie to God. The self-righteous person is simply a person who lies to God about how great he is. This was Peter at the Last Supper: "Even if they all fall away, I never will." But now, Peter has learned the painful lesson that honesty is the only path forward.</p>
                    <p>It's going to be better for you to be overwhelmed by your own depravity this week than it will be to be surprised by it on judgment day. Honesty about our failures and limitations isn't pleasant, but it creates the space for genuine restoration to begin.</p>

                        <li>In what areas of your life are you most tempted to present a "fake you" rather than being honest about your struggles?</li>
                        <li>How has dishonesty with yourself affected your relationships with others and with God?</li>
                        <li>What would it look like to approach Jesus with complete honesty about where you're at spiritually right now?</li>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Heavenly Father, thank You for the example of Peter's newfound honesty. I confess that I often prefer "fake me" to "real me"—both in how I see myself and how I present myself to others. Forgive me for the times I've exaggerated my spiritual maturity or hidden my struggles. Help me to see myself with sober judgment, neither minimizing my sin nor forgetting Your grace. Give me courage to be honest with myself, with others, and especially with You. Thank You that I don't need to impress You or hide from You—that You already know the real me and love me completely. In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Take time today to practice radical honesty with God. Write a letter to Him expressing where you're really at spiritually—not where you think you should be or want others to think you are. Include your doubts, struggles, and areas where your commitment feels weak. Then, destroy the letter (since this is between you and God) and thank Him that His love for you isn't based on your performance.</p>
