                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser... I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.</p>
                    <p>— John 15:1, 5 (ESV)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="devotional-text">
                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>When Jesus declares "I am the true vine," He's making a profound statement about His identity. This is one of Jesus's seven "I AM" statements in the Gospel of John, directly connecting to God's self-identification to Moses as "I AM WHO I AM" in Exodus 3. This isn't just beautiful imagery—it's a claim to divinity.</p>
                    <p>Jesus specifically calls Himself the "true" vine, implying there are false vines competing for our attachment. We often connect ourselves to these false vines seeking life, strength, and satisfaction. Sometimes we attach to sin, believing it will bring fulfillment. Other times, we make people our vine, expecting them to be our source of life and meaning. We might even turn opportunities, achievements, or possessions into vines, thinking "If I could just get the right job, neighborhood, or relationship, then I'd be satisfied."</p>
                    <p>But these false vines ultimately disappoint us. Sin promises life but takes it away. People, despite their best intentions, are finite and fallible. Material success leaves us wanting more. Only Jesus, the true vine, can provide the lasting life and satisfaction our souls crave.</p>
                    <p>We must also be careful not to "domesticate" Jesus—turning Him into "a bigger, better version of ourselves who is occasionally maybe slightly bothered by a few things we do." This diminished version of Jesus can't save us or transform us. The true vine isn't a tame, accommodating Jesus who affirms our every desire. He's the self-defining, self-existing God who calls us to connection on His terms, not ours.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>What "false vines" have I been attaching myself to, expecting them to give me life?</li>
                        <li>In what ways have I tried to domesticate Jesus to make Him more comfortable or convenient?</li>
                        <li>What would change in my life if I truly connected to Jesus as the only source of spiritual life?</li>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Lord Jesus, thank You for being the true vine—the only genuine source of spiritual life. Forgive me for the times I've attached myself to false vines, expecting them to give what only You can provide. Help me to see the ways I've tried to remake You in my image rather than allowing You to transform me into Yours. I acknowledge that apart from You, I can do nothing of eternal value. Teach me what it means to remain connected to You throughout each day, drawing my strength, purpose, and identity from our relationship. May my life reflect the reality that You are not just a part of my life, but the very source of it. In Your name I pray, Amen.</p>
