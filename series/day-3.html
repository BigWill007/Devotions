                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>Matthew 4:19 (ESV)</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
                    </blockquote>

                <div class="devotional-text">
                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>"Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men." With these simple words, Jesus reveals something profound about discipleship: it's not just about what we leave behind, but about what we're called to become.</p>
                    <p>Notice that Jesus doesn't just say, "Follow me." He adds a purpose statement—"I will make you fishers of men." This tells us that following Jesus isn't just about personal spiritual growth; it's about being transformed for a mission.</p>
                    <p>Jesus uses language that connects with these men's identity. They were fishermen—that's what they knew, what they were good at, what defined their daily lives. Jesus doesn't discard their identity but transforms it. They would still be fishermen, but now they would "catch" people for the kingdom of God.</p>
                    <p>This is how Jesus often works in our lives. He doesn't typically erase who we are when we follow Him. Instead, He redirects our skills, passions, and experiences toward His purposes. The accountant becomes someone who helps others steward God's resources. The teacher becomes someone who helps others understand God's truth. The parent becomes someone who disciples the next generation.</p>
                    <p>The phrase "fishers of men" might sound strange to our modern ears, but the meaning is clear: Jesus was calling these men to participate in His mission of drawing people to God. They would help others find and follow Jesus just as they were doing.</p>
                    <p>This reveals an important truth about discipleship: a disciple is someone who follows Jesus and helps others find and follow Jesus. We're not just consumers of spiritual content; we're called to be disciple-makers ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Think about what these fishermen knew about their trade:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They understood patience—sometimes you fish all night and catch nothing.</li>
                        <li>They knew about persistence—you don't give up after one empty net.</li>
                        <li>They were familiar with discernment—knowing where to cast the net and when.</li>
                        <li>They recognized the importance of teamwork—fishing was often a communal activity.</li>
                        <li>They had learned to navigate storms and changing conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All these skills and experiences would serve them well in their new mission of reaching people with the good news of Jesus. What looked like ordinary work experience became preparation for extraordinary kingdom work.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>How has Jesus repurposed your skills, experiences, or relationships for His kingdom purposes?</li>
                        <li>What does it mean to you personally to be a "fisher of men" in your current season of life?</li>
                        <li>Who are the specific people in your life that God might be calling you to help find and follow Jesus?</li>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Lord Jesus, thank You for not just calling me to follow You but for giving me a purpose in Your kingdom. Help me to see how You want to use my unique background, skills, and relationships to help others find and follow You. Forgive me for the times I've seen my faith as just about my personal relationship with You rather than about joining Your mission. Give me courage to embrace my identity as a "fisher of men." Show me the people You've placed in my life who need to know You, and teach me how to effectively share Your love and truth with them. In Your name I pray, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Make a list of 3-5 people in your life who don't know Jesus or who have drifted away from faith. Commit to praying for them daily this week. Then identify one specific step you can take to build a relationship with one of these people or to have a spiritual conversation with them if the relationship already exists.</p>
