                    <blockquote>
                        Then he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat. And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, "He is out of his mind."
                        Then his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside they sent to him and called him. And a crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, "Your mother and your brothers are outside, seeking you." And he answered them, "Who are my mother and my brothers?" And looking about at those who sat around him, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother."

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>Following Jesus sometimes creates tension with those closest to us.</p>
                    <p>In today's passage, we encounter a startling reality: Jesus's own family thought He was "out of his mind." The very people who should have known Him best and supported Him most were actually trying to stop His ministry. They came to "seize him"â€”to take Him home and end what they perceived as bizarre behavior.</p>
                    <p>Why would His family react this way? Several possibilities exist. They may have been concerned for His safety, seeing the growing opposition from religious and political leaders. They may have worried about their family reputation in a culture where honor was paramount. They may have genuinely believed His intense ministry schedule and bold claims indicated mental instability.</p>
                    <p>Whatever their reasons, this moment reveals a painful truth: sometimes following Jesus creates relational tension, even with family.</p>
                    <p>Jesus's response is equally striking. When told His mother and brothers were outside looking for Him, He redefines family: "Whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother." This wasn't a rejection of His biological family but an expansion of the concept of family to include spiritual bonds.</p>
                    <p>This teaches us several important truths:</p>

                    <p>First, if Jesus Himself experienced family tension because of His ministry, we shouldn't be surprised when our commitment to Christ creates friction in our relationships. Jesus warned that He came "not to bring peace, but a sword" and that "a person's enemies will be those of his own household" (Matthew 10:34, 36). This doesn't mean Jesus wants family conflict, but rather that divided loyalties are sometimes unavoidable when some family members follow Christ and others don't.</p>
                    <p>Second, while honoring parents and loving family remains a biblical command, our primary allegiance must be to God. When family expectations conflict with clear biblical commands or God's calling on our lives, we must choose obedience to God, even at relational cost.</p>
                    <p>Third, God provides a spiritual family to support us when biological family relationships are strained. The church isn't just an organization; it's a family where we find brothers, sisters, mothers, and fathers in the faith who encourage us to follow Christ faithfully.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we should maintain hope for our unbelieving or unsupportive family members. Mark's Gospel doesn't end the story here. By the time the book of Acts opens, we find Jesus's brothers among the believers (Acts 1:14). James, who once thought Jesus was crazy, became a leader in the early church and wrote the epistle bearing his name. Family members who initially resist our faith may eventually embrace it themselves.</p>
                    <p>If you're experiencing family tension because of your faith, take heart. Jesus understands. He experienced it too. And He promises that whatever family relationships we may lose for His sake, He will restore many times over through the gift of spiritual family (Mark 10:29-30).</p>

                    <p>Heavenly Father, thank You for the example of Jesus, who remained faithful to Your calling even when His own family didn't understand. For those of us experiencing family tension because of our faith, give us wisdom to navigate these relationships with both truth and grace. Help us to honor our families while keeping You as our highest priority. Thank You for the gift of spiritual family through the church. Help me to be a good brother/sister to those You've placed in my life. For family members who don't yet know You, I pray that You would soften their hearts and draw them to Yourself. In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>
