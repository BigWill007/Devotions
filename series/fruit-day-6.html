                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.</p>
                    <p>— John 15:16 (ESV)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="devotional-text">
                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>In our image-conscious culture, it can be tempting to focus more on the appearance of fruitfulness than on actual fruit. We might engage in religious activities, use spiritual language, or maintain a Christian reputation without experiencing genuine transformation. This is like hanging plastic fruit on a tree—it might look impressive from a distance, but it provides no nourishment and doesn't reproduce.</p>
                    <p>Jesus makes it clear that He chose and appointed us specifically "to go and bear fruit"— not fake fruit, but authentic, lasting fruit. The phrase "that your fruit should abide" indicates that Jesus is concerned with fruit that endures, not just temporary or superficial changes.</p>
                    <p>What does authentic fruit look like? First, it includes the fruit of the Spirit mentioned in Galatians 5:22-23: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. These character qualities reflect the nature of Christ being formed in us.</p>
                    <p>Second, authentic fruit includes the fruit of good works—acts of service, generosity, and ministry that flow from our relationship with Christ. Jesus frequently connected fruitfulness with action, saying things like "By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another" (John 13:35).</p>
                    <p>Third, authentic fruit includes the fruit of evangelism—people coming to faith in Christ through our witness. When Paul writes to the Romans, he expresses his desire to have "some fruit" among them (Romans 1:13), referring to the spread of the gospel and the growth of believers.</p>
                    <p>How can we ensure our fruit is authentic rather than artificial? It starts with abiding in Christ, as we've already seen. Authentic fruit grows naturally from a vital connection to Jesus. It also requires honesty about where we're struggling, rather than pretending to have it all together. And it involves accountability within the body of Christ, allowing others to speak truth into our lives.</p>
                    <p>The beautiful promise in today's verse is that as we bear authentic fruit, our prayers become more effective. Jesus says, "so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you." As we align our lives with God's purposes through fruitfulness, our desires and prayers naturally align with His will.</p>
                    <p>Today, ask God to reveal any areas where you might be settling for the appearance of fruitfulness rather than the reality. Commit to pursuing authentic transformation that brings glory to God and blessing to others.</p>

                        <li>In what areas of your life might you be more concerned with appearing fruitful than actually being fruitful?</li>
                        <li>Which aspect of authentic fruit (fruit of the Spirit, good works, evangelism) do you find most challenging to cultivate? Why?</li>
                        <li>How might your prayer life change if you focused more on bearing authentic fruit?</li>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Heavenly Father, thank You for choosing me and appointing me to bear lasting fruit. Forgive me for the times I've been more concerned with appearances than reality. I don't want to settle for plastic fruit in my life—I want the authentic transformation that comes only through abiding in Christ. Help me to be honest about my struggles and open to accountability. Cultivate in me the fruit of Your Spirit, the fruit of good works, and the fruit of effective witness. May my life produce fruit that remains and brings glory to Your name. In Jesus's name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Identify one area where you might be settling for "fake fruit"—perhaps a spiritual discipline you practice without heart engagement, a ministry you perform out of obligation, or a character quality you project but haven't truly developed. Confess this to God and one trusted friend, and ask for help in cultivating authentic fruit in this area.</p>
