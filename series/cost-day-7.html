                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>Throughout this week, we've explored the cost of discipleship—both what it cost Christ and what it costs us. Today, we focus on the value of discipleship—why the cost, great as it is, is worth it.</p>
                    <p>Jesus presents us with a paradox: "Whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it." This is one of those statements that sounds profound but can be difficult to understand practically. Let's unpack it with some concrete examples.</p>
                    <p>When you get married, you lose your life as a single person and find a new life as a spouse. You give up certain freedoms and take on new responsibilities. There's a real cost. But what you gain—intimacy, partnership, shared joy—is of greater value than what you lose.</p>
                    <p>When you have children, you lose more of your life—your sleep, your schedule, your disposable income. But you find a new life as a parent, experiencing a love and purpose that wasn't possible before. Again, the value exceeds the cost.</p>
                    <p>When you commit to a career or calling, you lose the opportunity to pursue other paths. But you find fulfillment in developing expertise and making a contribution in your chosen field. The specialization is worth the sacrifice of other options.</p>
                    <p>In each case, something is lost, but something greater is found. This is the pattern of discipleship. We lose our autonomy but find freedom in submission to Christ. We lose our self-centeredness but find joy in loving God and others. We lose our worldly security but find unshakable hope in God's promises.</p>
                    <p>Jesus reinforces this value proposition with two penetrating questions: "For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?"</p>
                    <p>Imagine gaining everything this world has to offer—all its wealth, pleasure, power, and acclaim. You have the biggest house, the fastest car, the most prestigious job, the largest following. You've "made it" by every worldly standard. But in the process, you've lost your soul—your connection to God, your eternal destiny, your true purpose. Would it be worth it? Jesus's question answers itself: No profit at all.</p>
                    <p>And once lost, what could you possibly offer to buy your soul back? Nothing in this world is valuable enough to redeem a human soul. Only Christ's blood is sufficient for that.</p>
                    <p>Jesus concludes with a reminder of eternal accountability: "For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay each person according to what he has done." This isn't teaching salvation by works but reminding us that our choices matter eternally. How we respond to Christ's call to discipleship has consequences beyond this life.</p>
                    <p>This perspective transforms how we view the cost of discipleship. When we consider the eternal value of what Christ offers—forgiveness, purpose, relationship with God, eternal life—the sacrifices of following Him, real as they are, pale in comparison. As Paul wrote, "For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us" (Romans 8:18).</p>
                    <p>Today, consider the value of discipleship in your own life. How has following Jesus, despite the cost, brought you life, purpose, and joy? How does the promise of Christ's return and reward strengthen your commitment to discipleship? And how might remembering the eternal value of your soul help you resist the temptation to gain the world at the expense of your soul?</p>
                    <p>Jesus concludes His teaching on discipleship with a powerful statement about value. He says that trying to save our lives (living for ourselves) actually leads to losing them. But losing our lives for His sake (living for Him) leads to finding true life.</p>
                    <p>The question He poses is profound: "What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul?" The answer is clear: nothing. All the wealth, power, and success in the world cannot compare to the value of our soul and our relationship with God.</p>
                    <p>Discipleship may come with a cost, but it also comes with incredible value. When we follow Jesus:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We find true purpose and meaning</li>
                        <li>We experience real freedom from sin</li>
                        <li>We receive eternal life</li>
                        <li>We become part of God's family</li>
                        <li>We discover our true identity</li>
                        <li>We experience the power of the Holy Spirit</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The value of discipleship far outweighs any cost. It's not about losing everything; it's about gaining everything that truly matters. It's about trading temporary pleasures for eternal joy, earthly treasures for heavenly riches, and momentary comfort for eternal purpose.</p>

                        <li>In what specific ways have you experienced the paradox of finding life by losing it for Christ's sake?</li>
                        <li>What aspects of "gaining the world" are most tempting to you personally?</li>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Heavenly Father, thank You for the incomparable value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. Help me to count everything else as loss compared to the surpassing worth of knowing Him. When I'm tempted to save my life, remind me that I'll only find true life by losing it for Your sake. When I'm drawn to gain the world, remind me of the value of my soul. When the cost of discipleship seems high, help me to remember the eternal weight of glory that far exceeds it all. Thank You that You always give more than You ask, that I can never outgive You. In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Take time to write down the specific ways following Jesus has brought value to your life, despite the costs. Then identify one area where you're currently being tempted to "gain the world" at the expense of your soul. Make a concrete plan for how you will choose discipleship over worldly gain in this area this week.</p>
