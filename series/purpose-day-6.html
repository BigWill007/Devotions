                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>As Jesus continues His instructions to the disciples, He establishes an important principle for ministry: "You received without paying; give without pay." This statement reminds the disciples that everything they have—their salvation, their authority, their message—has been freely given to them by God's grace. In response, they are to freely share with others.
                    This principle challenges our natural tendency toward self-interest and transaction. We often think in terms of "what's in it for me?" or "what will I get in return?" But Jesus calls His followers to a different way—a way of generosity and grace that reflects God's own character.
                    The teaching points out that this principle applies to all aspects of our lives, not just our financial resources. We freely give our time, our talents, our attention, and our care because we have freely received these gifts from God. We don't minister to others to get something in return; we minister because we've already received everything we need in Christ.
                    Jesus goes on to instruct the disciples to travel light: "Acquire no gold or silver or copper for your belts, no bag for your journey, or two tunics or sandals or a staff." This command teaches the disciples to depend on God's provision rather than their own resources. It's a lesson in trust—trust that God will supply their needs as they faithfully carry out His mission.
                    The message highlights how this principle of "freely received, freely give" applies specifically to evangelism. We don't share the gospel to get credit or recognition. We don't withhold the gospel from those we deem unworthy. We don't use the gospel as a means to some other end. Instead, we freely offer the good news of Jesus Christ to everyone, regardless of their status, background, or potential response.
                    This principle also challenges our attitude toward ministry. Sometimes we can develop a sense of entitlement or resentment when our service isn't acknowledged or appreciated. We might think, "After all I've done, this is how they treat me?" But Jesus reminds us that we serve not to receive human recognition but in grateful response to what we've already received from God.
                    At the same time, Jesus affirms that "the laborer deserves his food." While the disciples weren't to demand payment for their ministry, Jesus acknowledges that those who devote themselves to gospel work deserve to have their basic needs met. This is why the New Testament elsewhere affirms the principle of supporting those who preach the gospel (1 Corinthians 9:14; 1 Timothy 5:17-18).
                    Today, consider how the principle "freely received, freely give" might transform your approach to sharing Christ with others. How can you be more generous with the gospel, freely offering to others what God has freely given to you?</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>What specific gifts, abilities, or resources has God freely given to you that you can use to serve others?</li>
                        <li>In what ways might you be holding back from freely giving to others? What motivations or fears are behind this hesitation?</li>
                        <li>How does remembering all that you've freely received from God change your attitude toward serving and giving to others?</li>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Heavenly Father, thank You for all that You have freely given me—salvation through Christ, the gift of Your Spirit, spiritual gifts, material blessings, and so much more. Forgive me for the times I've been stingy or self-serving with what You've entrusted to me. Help me to freely give as I have freely received. Teach me to depend on Your provision rather than my own resources. Give me a generous heart that reflects Your character and grace. Use me to freely share the gospel with those who need to hear it. In Jesus's name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Identify one specific way you can "freely give" this week in response to what you've freely received from God. It might be sharing your time with someone in need, using your talents to serve others, or giving financially to support gospel work. Commit to this act of generosity as an expression of gratitude for God's grace in your life.</p>
