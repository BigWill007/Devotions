                    <p>Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues, and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles.
                    — Matthew 10:16-18 (ESV)</p>

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>As Jesus concludes His instructions to the disciples, He gives them a sobering reality check: "I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves." He doesn't sugarcoat the challenges they will face. He doesn't promise that everyone will welcome their message or appreciate their ministry. Instead, He prepares them for opposition and persecution.
                    This honest assessment is actually an expression of Jesus's love for His disciples. He doesn't want them to be surprised or disillusioned when they face resistance. He wants them to be prepared, to understand that opposition is not a sign of failure but an expected part of faithful witness.
                    The teaching points out that Christians throughout history and around the world today face various forms of persecution for their faith. In some places, this includes imprisonment, torture, or even death. In other contexts, the opposition might take the form of ridicule, exclusion, or discrimination. Jesus wants His followers to expect opposition so they can persevere through it.
                    But Jesus doesn't just warn the disciples about opposition; He also gives them guidance for navigating it: "Be wise as serpents and innocent as doves." This memorable phrase calls for a balance of strategic wisdom and moral integrity. The disciples are to be shrewd in understanding the world around them, anticipating challenges, and finding effective ways to share the gospel. At the same time, they are to maintain their integrity, not compromising their witness through deception, manipulation, or retaliation.
                    The message emphasizes that opposition often creates unique opportunities for witness. Jesus tells the disciples they will be "dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles." What appears to be a setback from a human perspective can be a divine setup for the gospel to reach people who might not otherwise hear it. Throughout the book of Acts and church history, we see how persecution often served to spread the gospel further and wider than before.
                    This perspective transforms how we view opposition. Rather than seeing it as something to avoid at all costs or as evidence that we're doing something wrong, we can see it as an expected part of faithful witness and even as an opportunity for the gospel to advance in new ways.
                    Today, consider how you respond to opposition or resistance when you share your faith. Do you retreat in fear, or do you persevere with wisdom and integrity? Do you see opposition as an obstacle to be avoided or as an opportunity for witness? Ask God to give you the courage and perspective you need to faithfully represent Christ, even when it's difficult or costly.</p>
