                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>As we conclude our journey through Peter's restoration, it's worth stepping back to appreciate the epic comeback that followed. The man who denied Jesus three times would soon stand before thousands at Pentecost, boldly proclaiming the risen Christ. The disciple who cowered before a servant girl would later face imprisonment, beatings, and eventually martyrdom for his faith. The failure became a foundation for one of the most influential lives in Christian history.</p>
                    <p>This is the final step in making a comeback: believe that God can write an epic comeback story through your life. As the text reminds us, "Your failure is not final. It's not fatal. It's not finished. It's not fatal to your faith. It's not fatal to your future. It's not fatal to your family. It's not fatal to your friendships."</p>
                    <p>Peter's story teaches us that our failures don't determine our future—God does. And He specializes in redemption stories. Throughout Scripture and church history, we see God using broken, failed people to accomplish His purposes. Moses was a murderer. David was an adulterer. Paul persecuted the church. Yet God used each of them powerfully after their restoration.</p>
                    <p>What makes these comeback stories possible? It's not the person's inherent strength or ability to bounce back. It's God's grace and power working through them. As Peter himself would later write, "And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you" (1 Peter 5:10).</p>
                    <p>The text points out that "the comeback is not about you becoming awesome again. It's about Jesus being awesome through you." This is crucial. If we approach restoration as a self-improvement project or an attempt to rebuild our reputation, we've missed the point. True restoration puts Jesus at the center, not us.</p>
                    <p>Peter's comeback wasn't instantaneous. Between his restoration by the sea and his powerful preaching at Pentecost, there was a period of waiting and preparation. Acts 1 tells us that the disciples spent time in prayer and fellowship before the Holy Spirit came upon them with power. This reminds us that comebacks often require patience and preparation.</p>
                    <p>The text also emphasizes that "your comeback will probably look different than you think." Peter might have imagined returning to his former life as a fisherman, but God had much bigger plans. Your restoration might lead you in unexpected directions as well—perhaps to new relationships, new ministries, or new ways of using your gifts.</p>
                    <p>As you reflect on your own journey of failure and restoration, remember that the story isn't over yet. God is still writing your comeback. And the greatest comeback of all—the resurrection of Jesus from the dead—guarantees that those who trust in Him will ultimately triumph over every failure and sin.</p>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Heavenly Father, thank You for being the God of epic comebacks. Thank You for showing through Peter's life that failure is not the end of the story when You're involved. I confess that I sometimes struggle to believe You can bring good out of my failures or use me powerfully after I've fallen. Help me to trust in Your redemptive power and grace. Thank You that the comeback isn't about me becoming awesome again, but about Jesus being awesome through me. Give me patience during the preparation process, and openness to whatever plans You have for my restored life. May my story of failure and comeback ultimately bring glory to Your name. In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Look back at the journal entry you wrote on Day 1 about a significant failure in your life. Now, write a "comeback vision"—a prayerful description of how God might redeem this failure for His purposes. Include specific ways He might use your experience to help others, advance His kingdom, or shape you more into the image of Christ. Conclude by thanking God for His redemptive work in your life.</p>
