                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>When Jesus sends out His disciples, He gives them a clear mission: "proclaim as you go." The message they are to announce is simple yet profound: "The kingdom of heaven is at hand." This isn't just information to be shared; it's a reality to be proclaimed—God's rule and reign have broken into human history through Jesus Christ.
                    But Jesus doesn't just tell them what to say; He also tells them what to do: "Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons." These are extraordinary commands that would require extraordinary faith. Jesus is calling His disciples to take significant risks for the sake of the gospel.
                    The teaching points out that many Christians today are risk-averse when it comes to sharing their faith. We worry about saying the wrong thing, being rejected, or making someone uncomfortable. We fear awkward conversations or damaged relationships. So we play it safe, keeping our faith private and missing opportunities to share the hope we have in Christ.
                    But the gospel itself is a message of risk. God took the ultimate risk in sending His Son to die for sinners who might reject Him. Jesus took risks in associating with tax collectors and sinners, healing on the Sabbath, and challenging religious authorities. The early church took risks in proclaiming Christ in the face of persecution. Throughout church history, the gospel has advanced through people willing to take risks for the sake of Christ.
                    The message suggests that we need to recapture this willingness to take "gospel risks"— steps of faith that push us beyond our comfort zones for the sake of sharing Christ with others. These risks might include:
                    •	Initiating spiritual conversations with colleagues or neighbors
                    •	Inviting someone to church or a Bible study
                    •	Sharing your testimony with a friend
                    •	Offering to pray for someone who's struggling
                    •	Going on a short-term mission trip
                    •	Moving to an unreached area to share Christ
                    Taking these risks doesn't mean being reckless or insensitive. It means being willing to step out in faith, trusting that God will work through our obedience, even when it feels uncomfortable or uncertain.
                    The teaching also emphasizes that we don't take these risks alone. Jesus gave His disciples authority before He sent them out. Similarly, He has given us His Spirit, His Word, and His church to equip and empower us for the mission. We step out in His strength, not our own.
                    Today, consider what gospel risks God might be calling you to take. Where have you been playing it safe when it comes to sharing your faith? What step of obedience feels risky but right?</p>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Lord Jesus, thank You for taking the ultimate risk of leaving heaven to come to earth and die for my sins. Forgive me for the times I've played it safe rather than boldly proclaiming Your kingdom. Help me to overcome my fears and insecurities about sharing my faith. Give me courage to take gospel risks—to initiate conversations, to invite others to know You, to step out of my comfort zone for the sake of Your mission.
                    Remind me that You have given me Your authority and presence as I go. Use me to bring Your kingdom near to those around me. In Your name I pray, Amen.</p>

                    <p>Identify one specific "gospel risk" you can take this week. It might be initiating a spiritual conversation with a colleague, inviting a neighbor to church, or offering to pray for someone who's struggling. Write down your plan, pray for courage, and commit to taking this step of faith.</p>
