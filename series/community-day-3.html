                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>Mark 3:7-8 (ESV)</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd followed, from Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon. When the great crowd heard all that he was doing, they came to him.

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>There's a significant difference between following Jesus and being a fan of Jesus.</p>
                    <p>In Mark 3, we see massive crowds following Jesus everywhere He went. They came from all directions—Galilee, Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and from around Tyre and Sidon. These weren't small gatherings; they were so large that Jesus had to tell His disciples to have a boat ready for Him to avoid being crushed.</p>
                    <p>Why did they come? The text tells us: "When the great crowd heard all that he was doing, they came to him." They were drawn by His miracles, His teaching, His reputation. They loved what Jesus could do for them, but many didn't truly understand who He was.</p>
                    <p>This presents us with an important question: Are we followers or just fans?</p>
                    <p>Fans show up when it's convenient and exciting. They enjoy the experience but remain at a distance. They want the benefits without the commitment. Fans of Jesus want His blessings, His comfort, His solutions to problems—but they may not want His lordship, His commands, or His call to die to self.</p>
                    <p>Followers, on the other hand, commit to the person of Jesus, not just His benefits. They stay even when the teaching is difficult or the path is challenging. They're not just consumers of spiritual content; they're committed disciples who reorient their entire lives around Jesus and His mission.</p>
                    <p>The crowds in Mark 3 loved Jesus but didn't understand Him. Many were there for what they could get—healing, excitement, a break from ordinary life. Jesus knew this. He knew the difference between the curious crowds and the committed disciples.</p>
                    <p>This is why Jesus eventually called twelve specific individuals out from the crowd. He was looking for depth, not just breadth. He wanted followers, not just fans.</p>
                    <p>In our culture of casual Christianity, it's easy to be a fan. We can attend worship gatherings, listen to Christian podcasts, wear Christian t-shirts, and post Bible verses on social media—all without the deep commitment of true discipleship. We can be consumers rather than disciples.</p>
                    <p>True discipleship moves us from the crowd to commitment, from the periphery to the center, from being served to serving others. It calls us to open not just our Bibles but our lives—to be vulnerable, accountable, and deeply connected with other believers.</p>
                    <p>Today, consider where you are in relation to Jesus. Are you in the crowd, enjoying the benefits but keeping a safe distance? Or are you among those who have responded to His call to "follow me" with your whole life?</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>What initially drew you to Jesus? Has your motivation for following Him changed over time?</li>
                        <li>In what ways might you be treating Jesus more like a celebrity to admire than a Lord to follow?</li>
                        <li>What would it look like for you to move from being in the crowd to being more deeply committed to Jesus?</li>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Lord Jesus, search my heart and show me where I might be more of a fan than a follower. Forgive me for the times I've wanted Your blessings without Your lordship, Your comfort without Your commands. Thank You for continuing to call me deeper into relationship with You. Help me to move beyond the crowd mentality and embrace true discipleship. Give me courage to open not just my Bible but my life to You and to others. In Your name I pray, Amen.</p>
