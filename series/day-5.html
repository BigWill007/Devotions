                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>Matthew 4:12-14 (ESV)</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee. And leaving Nazareth he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali, so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled.

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes the most significant turning points in our lives come from unexpected circumstances. For Jesus, the arrest of John the Baptist became a catalytic moment that launched Him into His public ministry.</p>
                    <p>John's arrest could have been seen as a setback for the kingdom of God. After all, John was the prophetic voice preparing the way for the Messiah. His imprisonment might have seemed like a victory for the forces opposing God's work. But Jesus saw it differently. He recognized it as a divine signal that it was time for Him to step forward.</p>
                    <p>Notice Jesus' response: "Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee." Jesus didn't rush to Jerusalem to protest John's arrest or organize a prison break. Instead, He moved to Galilee—specifically to Capernaum—and began His ministry there. This wasn't a random choice; it was a strategic one that fulfilled prophecy.</p>
                    <p>Matthew points out that this move fulfilled what Isaiah had prophesied centuries earlier about a light dawning in the land of Zebulun and Naphtali. What might have looked like a retreat was actually an advance in God's plan.</p>
                    <p>This teaches us something important about how God works. Often, what appears to be a setback or disappointment in our lives becomes the very thing God uses to move us forward in His purposes. The loss of a job leads to a better opportunity. A relationship ending creates space for growth. A health crisis deepens our dependence on God.</p>
                    <p>These catalytic moments—these unexpected turns in the road—often become the launching pads for new seasons of ministry and growth. The question is: How do we respond when they come?</p>
                    <p>Jesus responded with clarity and purpose. He didn't waste energy fighting against what couldn't be changed (John's arrest). Instead, He focused on what He was called to do next. He moved to the place where God wanted Him and began the ministry He was sent to fulfill.</p>
                    <p>What catalytic moments have you experienced? Perhaps you've faced a sudden change in circumstances—a move, a job loss, a health diagnosis, a relationship change. Or maybe you've experienced an internal catalyst—a moment of clarity, a conviction, a new understanding of God's call on your life.</p>
                    <p>The key is not just to recognize these moments but to respond to them with faith and obedience, as Jesus did. Instead of seeing them only as problems to be solved or hurdles to overcome, we can view them as potential turning points that God can use to direct our paths.</p>
                    <p>Jesus' move to Capernaum wasn't just about geography; it was about positioning Himself to fulfill His mission. In the same way, our responses to life's unexpected turns should be guided by our understanding of God's purposes for our lives.</p>
                    <p>As disciples of Jesus, we're called to follow His example—to discern the hand of God even in difficult circumstances and to move forward in faith, trusting that He is working out His purposes even when the path takes an unexpected turn.</p>
