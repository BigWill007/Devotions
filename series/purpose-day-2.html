                    <p>Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest."
                    — Matthew 9:37-38 (ESV)</p>

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>Jesus uses a powerful metaphor in today's passage. He looks at the crowds of people and doesn't see problems or threats—He sees a harvest. This agricultural image would have resonated deeply with His disciples, who lived in an agrarian society where harvest time was crucial.
                    When Jesus says "the harvest is plentiful," He's making a profound statement about spiritual readiness. There are people—many people—who are spiritually prepared to hear and respond to the gospel. As the teaching points out, this is true both globally and locally.
                    Globally, the numbers are staggering. According to the Joshua Project data mentioned in the message, there are approximately 3.4 billion people in unreached people groups— people with little to no access to the gospel. That's nearly half the world's population! If these people were lined up two feet apart, they would circle the globe 52 times. Even more sobering, 87% of Buddhists, Muslims, and Hindus will never meet a Christian in their entire lifetime.
                    But the harvest is also plentiful locally. Think about your workplace, your neighborhood, your gym, your children's school. How many people in these places don't know Christ?
                    The message suggests that in many workplaces, only 10-20% of people might identify as Christians. That means the majority of the people you interact with daily may not know the hope found in Jesus.
                    There's an important principle mentioned in the teaching: "The crowd is not the harvest, but the harvest is in the crowd." This means that not everyone will respond positively to the gospel, but some will. We shouldn't expect everyone to come to faith when we share the gospel, but we can be confident that God is working in some hearts to prepare them.
                    Jesus also notes that "the laborers are few." This isn't because Jesus is worried that people won't come to faith; rather, He's concerned that Christians won't go to lost people. The message points out that there are approximately 3,500 IMB missionaries— that's one missionary for every one million unreached people. The need for workers is overwhelming.
                    Today, ask God to open your eyes to see the harvest around you. Where has He placed you that gives you unique access to people who need to hear the gospel? Remember, the harvest is plentiful—people are ready to hear and respond to the good news of Jesus Christ.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Where do you see evidence of spiritual hunger or openness in the people around you?</li>
                        <li>What obstacles keep you from seeing the people in your life as a "plentiful harvest"?</li>
                        <li>How does the principle "the crowd is not the harvest, but the harvest is in the crowd" change how you think about sharing your faith?</li>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Lord of the harvest, open my eyes to see what You see—a plentiful harvest of souls ready to hear and respond to the gospel. Forgive me for the times I've been blind to the spiritual needs of those around me. Help me to recognize the harvest fields where You've placed me—my workplace, my neighborhood, my circle of friends. Give me faith to believe that You are already working in people's hearts, preparing them to hear the good news. In Jesus's name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Make a list of the "harvest fields" in your life—places where you regularly interact with people who don't know Christ (work, gym, neighborhood, etc.). For each one, write down the names of specific people you know there who don't have a relationship with Jesus. Choose one of these fields to focus on this week, asking God for opportunities to build relationships and have meaningful conversations.</p>
