                    <p>Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.
                    — Matthew 9:38 (ESV)</p>

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>After Jesus tells His disciples about the plentiful harvest and the scarcity of workers, He gives them a clear instruction: "pray earnestly." This is the first response Jesus calls for when we recognize the great need for the gospel in our world.
                    The word "earnestly" in this verse is significant. As the teaching points out, to do something earnestly means to do it "with sincere and intense conviction." Jesus isn't calling for casual, half-hearted prayers, but for fervent, passionate intercession that flows from a heart deeply concerned about the lost.
                    Charles Spurgeon, the great 19th-century preacher, confessed that this passage "haunted" him more than any other in Scripture. Why? Not because he couldn't see the need—the vast numbers of people without Christ—but because he didn't feel the kind of compassion that would drive him to pray with this level of earnestness. Many of us might relate to Spurgeon's struggle. We intellectually understand the need, but our hearts aren't always moved to fervent prayer.
                    The message raises an important application of this verse for parents and grandparents: What would it look like to be "open-handed" with our children when it comes to God's call on their lives? Often, we pray for our children's safety, success, and happiness—all good things—but we may be reluctant to pray for God to use them however He sees fit, especially if that means sending them far from home or into challenging circumstances.
                    The teaching describes how college students who want to participate in mission trips or consider vocational ministry often face resistance from their parents, who may try to "shame them or scare them" out of taking steps of faith. While providing wise counsel is important, parents are encouraged to hold their children with open hands, recognizing that from the moment we begin trying to have children until forever, we must trust God with their lives.
                    Being "open-handed" doesn't mean we don't care about our children's well-being; it means we recognize that they ultimately belong to God, not to us. They are "arrows," meant to be sent out, not "pieces of artwork" meant to be kept and displayed.
                    Today, consider how you can pray more earnestly for laborers to be sent into the harvest. And if you're a parent or grandparent, reflect on how you can support and encourage the next generation to follow God's call, wherever it may lead.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>When was the last time you prayed "earnestly" (with sincere and intense conviction) for anything? What was it?</li>
                        <li>What might be holding you back from praying earnestly for more workers in God's harvest?</li>
                        <li>If you're a parent or grandparent, how "open-handed" are you with your children's future? What fears or concerns make it difficult to release them to God's purposes?</li>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Lord of the harvest, forgive me for my lukewarm prayers and casual concern for the lost. Stir in me a sincere and intense conviction about the billions who don't know You. Give me a heart that is moved to earnest prayer—not just today, but consistently. I pray specifically for more workers to be sent into Your harvest fields, both locally and globally. Raise up a new generation of bold witnesses who will take the gospel to places where it has never been heard. And Lord, help me to hold with open hands the people and things You've entrusted to me, recognizing that everything and everyone ultimately belongs to You. In Jesus's name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Set aside 15 minutes today for focused, earnest prayer for laborers in the harvest. Pray for specific mission organizations, missionaries you know, or unreached people groups. If you're a parent, pray specifically for your children's spiritual growth and openness to God's call on their lives, whatever that may be.</p>
