                    <blockquote>
                        Immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them. Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>As we conclude our week-long journey exploring discipleship, we return to the powerful response of the first disciples: "Immediately they left their nets and followed him."</p>
                    <p>The word "immediately" appears twice in this short passage, emphasizing the decisive nature of their response. There was no hesitation, no negotiation, no "let me think about it." They recognized something in Jesus that was worth dropping everything to follow.</p>
                    <p>This immediate response is striking, especially considering what they were leaving behind. Their nets and boats represented their livelihood, their security, their identity. For James and John, leaving their father meant stepping away from the family business and the inheritance that would have been theirs.</p>
                    <p>Yet they did it "immediately." Why? Because they recognized that what Jesus offered was worth more than what they were leaving behind.</p>
                    <p>This challenges us to consider our own response to Jesus' call. Are we willing to follow Him immediately, or do we hesitate? Are we willing to leave behind whatever might hold us back, or do we cling to our "nets"?</p>
                    <p>Of course, following Jesus doesn't always mean physically leaving our jobs or families. But it does mean giving Jesus our primary allegiance. It means being willing to let go of whatever holds us back from fully following Him—whether sinful habits, toxic relationships, or even good things that have become too important.</p>
                    <p>What's striking about these disciples is that they left everything without knowing exactly where Jesus would lead them. They didn't have a detailed roadmap. They simply trusted that following Him was worth whatever they might leave behind.</p>
                    <p>The same is true for us. Following Jesus often means stepping into the unknown, trusting that wherever He leads is better than where we are now. It means being willing to take the next step of faith, even when we can't see the entire path ahead.</p>
                    <p>What is your next step of faith? Perhaps it's finally letting go of a habit or attitude that's been holding you back. Maybe it's stepping into a ministry opportunity you've been hesitating to pursue. Or it could be having that difficult conversation you've been avoiding.</p>
                    <p>Whatever it is, Jesus invites you to take that step today—not tomorrow, not when you feel more ready, but today. The disciples' immediate response reminds us that delayed obedience is often disobedience.</p>
                    <p>Remember, you don't have to have it all figured out. The disciples certainly didn't. They simply responded to Jesus' call and learned along the way. The same will be true for you. As you take each step of faith, Jesus will reveal the next one.</p>
                    <p>The journey of discipleship is just that—a journey. It's not about arriving at a destination but about following Jesus one step at a time, becoming more like Him each day, and helping others do the same.</p>
                    <p>As we conclude this devotional, my prayer is that you'll be encouraged to take your next step of faith—whatever that might be. The One who calls you is faithful, and He will equip you for whatever He calls you to do.</p>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Lord Jesus, thank You for the example of the first disciples who immediately left everything to follow You. Forgive me for the times I've hesitated or negotiated when You've called me to follow. Give me courage to take my next step of faith today—not tomorrow, not when I feel more ready, but today. Help me to trust that wherever You lead is better than where I am now. Thank You for Your patience with me as I learn to follow You one step at a time. In Your name I pray, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Identify one specific step of faith that Jesus is calling you to take. Write it down, share it with a trusted friend or mentor, and commit to taking that step this week. Remember, it doesn't have to be a giant leap—even small steps of obedience matter in the journey of discipleship.</p>
