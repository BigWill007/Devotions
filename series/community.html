                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This devotional explores what it means to follow Jesus in the context of community, based on Mark 3. Over the next seven days, we'll discover how Jesus interacted with different groups of people and what that teaches us about authentic discipleship. Each day includes Scripture from the ESV Bible, a devotional reflection, questions for personal application, a guided prayer, and a practical step to take.</p>
                <p>Whether you're just beginning your journey with Jesus or have been following Him for years, this devotional will help you understand what true discipleship looks like when lived out in relationship with others.</p>
