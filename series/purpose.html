                <div class="devotional-text">
                    <p>This devotional explores Jesus's call to mission through Matthew 9:35-10:15. Over the next seven days, we'll discover how Jesus sees the world, calls us to participate in His mission, and equips us to make disciples. Each day includes Scripture from the ESV Bible, a devotional reflection, questions for personal application, a guided prayer, and a practical step to take.</p>
                    <p>Whether you're new to mission work or seeking to deepen your commitment, this devotional will guide you through Jesus's vision for the harvest and your role in it. Through Jesus's example and teaching, we'll learn how to see the world as He sees it, pray for laborers, and step out in faith to share the gospel.</p>
