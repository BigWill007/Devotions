                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. — Matthew 9:35-36 (ESV)</p>

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>In our passage today, we see something profound about Jesus's heart. As He looked at the crowds of people—people with different backgrounds, different struggles, different sins—He didn't respond with anger or indifference. Instead, we're told that "he had compassion for them." The teaching points out that compassion is mentioned as Jesus's emotion more than any other in the New Testament. This is significant. When Jesus looked at lost people, His primary response was deep sympathy for their condition and a desire to help. Compassion comes from Latin roots meaning "to suffer with." It's more than just feeling sorry for someone; it's feeling their pain as if it were your own and being moved to action. Jesus saw that the crowds were "harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd," and His heart was moved. But as the message highlights, we often fall into two ditches on either side of compassion: The first ditch is anger. We look at non-Christians and think, "If they had just made better choices, they wouldn't be in this situation." We get frustrated when non-Christians don't act like Christians, which is actually quite unreasonable when you think about it. Why would we expect people who don't share our worldview to live according to it? The second ditch is apathy. This is perhaps the more common one—not in what we say we believe, but in how we actually live. We might claim to care about lost people, but our calendars and bank statements might tell a different story. We're busy with work, family, and other commitments, and concern for the lost often gets pushed to the back burner. Jesus calls us to a different way: controlled compassion. This means we genuinely feel the spiritual condition of those around us who don't know Christ, and we're moved to do something about it. We see them not as problems to be solved but as people with potential—potential to know God, to be transformed by His grace, and to join in His mission. Today, ask God to help you see people the way Jesus sees them. Ask Him to replace any anger or apathy in your heart with genuine compassion—the kind that moves you to action.</p>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Heavenly Father, forgive me for the times I've looked at lost people with anger or apathy rather than compassion. Help me to see people the way Jesus sees them—not as problems but as people with potential, people You love deeply. Give me Your heart of compassion that feels the spiritual condition of others and moves me to action. Show me specific ways I can express this compassion in my relationships with non-Christians. In Jesus's name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Identify one person in your life who doesn't know Christ. Take a few minutes to pray specifically for them, asking God to help you see them with compassion rather than judgment or indifference. Then, think of one practical way you can show Christ's love to them this week and commit to doing it.</p>
