                <div class="scripture">
                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.</p>
                    <p>— John 15:1-2 (ESV)</p>

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>Discipleship is not a nicety. It's a necessity. This statement challenges us to reconsider how we view our spiritual growth. Many of us approach discipleship as an optional add-on to our faith—something nice to have if we can fit it into our busy schedules. But Jesus presents a different perspective.</p>
                    <p>When Jesus describes Himself as "the true vine," He's establishing that connection to Him isn't optional for spiritual life. Just as a branch cannot survive without being connected to the vine, we cannot truly live spiritually without being connected to Christ. Discipleship isn't about checking religious boxes; it's about the vital, life-giving relationship that sustains us.</p>
                    <p>Discipleship happens in both easy and hard places. It's not just Bible reading with friends or attending retreats—though these are valuable. True discipleship also means walking with people through their hopes and hurts, through sin and suffering. It means being present when someone we love is struggling, even when we don't know exactly what to do or say.</p>
                    <p>This kind of discipleship requires intentionality and commitment. It means prioritizing our relationship with Christ and with fellow believers, even when it's difficult or uncomfortable. But the fruit that comes from this commitment—transformed lives and deeper relationships—makes it not just necessary but deeply worthwhile.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In what ways have I treated discipleship as optional rather than necessary in my life?</li>
                        <li>What "hard places" in my life or the lives of others am I avoiding because discipleship there seems too difficult?</li>
                        <li>How might my perspective change if I truly embraced discipleship as a necessity rather than a nicety?</li>

                <div class="prayer">
                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Heavenly Father, thank You for being the divine Gardener who cares for each branch. Forgive me for the times I've treated discipleship as optional. Help me to see my connection to Jesus, the True Vine, as essential for life. Give me courage to engage in discipleship not just in comfortable places but also in the hard places where growth often happens most profoundly. Show me how to walk alongside others through their hopes and hurts, just as You walk with me through mine. May my life bear the fruit that comes only from abiding in You. In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Identify one area of discipleship you've been treating as optional. Make a specific commitment to prioritize this area today, whether it's dedicated time in prayer, reaching out to someone who is hurting, or engaging more deeply with Scripture. Write down this commitment and share it with a trusted friend who can help hold you accountable.</p>
