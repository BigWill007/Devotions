                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>Mark 3:13-15 (ESV)</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        And he went up on the mountain and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him. And he appointed twelve (whom he also named apostles) so that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach and have authority to cast out demons.

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>Jesus calls us to relationship and responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Notice the purpose statement in today's passage: Jesus appointed the twelve "so that they might be with him and he might send them out." There are two parts to this calling: being with Jesus and being sent by Jesus. Relationship and responsibility.</p>
                    <p>This reveals something profound about discipleship. It's not just about acquiring information; it's about transformation through relationship that leads to mission. Jesus didn't just want the disciples to learn facts about God; He wanted them to know God personally through knowing Him. And He didn't want them to keep that relationship to themselves; He wanted it to overflow into mission.</p>
                    <p>Many of us tend to think about our faith primarily in terms of time and place: "I do my devotions at 7:30 AM" or "I attend church on Sundays" or "I go to community group on Tuesdays." But what if we thought more in terms of relationships and responsibilities? What if we focused on being with Jesus and being sent by Jesus in every context of our lives?</p>
                    <p>Another striking aspect of Jesus's discipleship is how He gathered such a diverse group. The twelve included fishermen and tax collectors, political zealots and common laborers. Some were married, others single. Some were educated, others not. They had different personalities, backgrounds, and perspectives.</p>
                    <p>In our natural tendency, we gravitate toward people who are like us—who share our interests, backgrounds, and viewpoints. But Jesus intentionally created a community that crossed social, economic, and political boundaries. This diversity wasn't accidental; it was essential to showing the unifying power of the gospel.</p>
                    <p>Jesus also understood that most things in discipleship are caught, not taught. While He certainly taught with words, much of what the disciples learned came from simply watching Jesus—how He prayed, how He responded to criticism, how He treated the marginalized, how He handled conflict. They caught His compassion, His priorities, His wisdom through proximity and observation.</p>
                    <p>This is why discipleship can't happen through books and lectures alone. It requires life-on-life interaction where we can see faith lived out in real time, in real situations. It's why hospitality becomes such a powerful tool for discipleship—inviting others into our homes, our routines, our families allows them to see how faith works in everyday life.</p>
                    <p>Consider how you might disciple out of your life stage and lifestyle. If you're a parent, invite singles to spend time with your family. If you're skilled in a particular area, mentor someone in that skill while intentionally incorporating spiritual conversation. Whatever your daily life involves, look for ways to invite others in with gospel intentionality.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>How balanced is your discipleship between "being with Jesus" (relationship) and "being sent by Jesus" (responsibility)?</li>
                        <li>In what ways has your community of faith challenged you through its diversity?</li>
                        <li>Who has discipled you most effectively through their example rather than just their words?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Lord Jesus, thank You for calling me into relationship with You and giving me responsibility in Your kingdom. Help me to prioritize both being with You and being sent by You. Thank You for the diverse community of believers You've placed in my life. Help me to learn from those who are different from me rather than only connecting with those who are similar. Show me how to open my life to others so they can see faith lived out in everyday situations. Use me to disciple others not just through my words but through my example. In Your name I pray, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Identify one aspect of your regular routine or lifestyle that you could invite someone else into with gospel intentionality. Make a plan to extend that invitation this week.</p>
