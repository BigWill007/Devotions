                    <p>"He appeared to Cephas [Peter], then to the twelve."</p>
                    <p>— 1 Corinthians 15:5 (ESV)</p>
                    <p>"When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?"</p>

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>By the time we reach the beach scene in John 21, something significant has already happened that's easy to miss. 1 Corinthians 15 says that Jesus appeared first to Peter and then to the 12.</p>
                    <p>This is the third step in making a comeback: meet with Jesus privately. After we've engaged community and started being honest, we need this intimate encounter with the risen Christ where real healing begins.</p>
                    <p>This meeting must be between "real you and the risen king"—not the polished, presentable version of yourself, but the authentic you with all your failures and shame. In this private meeting, Jesus offers something remarkable: "Your failure can stay buried in my grave if you take it."</p>
                    <p>This is the heart of the gospel. It's not about performing better or earning your way back into God's good graces. It's about receiving a gift—the gift of grace that Jesus purchased with His life. It's not "if you're a good boy for a while and perform." It's "No, no, no, no, no. It can stay buried in my grave if you'll take it. It's a gift."</p>
                    <p>For some of us, this private meeting is difficult because we believe Jesus actually hates us for what we've done. We think the meeting will be "an absolute tongue lashing or worse." So instead, we try to "lock it up, lock it away, perform, and put time and good works between your past and your present." But deep down, we know that He knows, and it's not working.</p>
                    <p>For so many of us, this is the hardest thing to do in Christianity—to believe that He actually loves real you. Not fake you, not the one who shows up smiling and singing. Real you. But if you're ever going to make a comeback, you need to meet with Jesus privately about those things you've been hiding.</p>
                    <p>And in that meeting, you need to hear Him say, "I know. It's okay. It's okay. I know. But I've always known. Two thousand years ago, before you existed, I knew. And I put it on my back, and I died in your place. But I'm alive again. And that failure, it can stay buried if you'll take it. You can't earn it. Just take it. It's a gift."</p>

                    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>What makes it difficult for you to meet privately with Jesus about your failures and sins?</li>
                        <li>Is there something specific you've been avoiding bringing to Jesus because you fear His response?</li>
                        <li>How might your relationship with Christ change if you truly believed He loves "real you," not just the presentable version?</li>

                <div class="prayer">
                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Lord Jesus, thank You for seeking out Peter privately before the group restoration. Thank You for doing the same with me. I confess that I often avoid these private meetings with You because I'm afraid of what You'll say or how You'll look at me. Help me to believe the truth—that You already know my failures and love me anyway. Thank You that Your grace is a gift, not something I can earn through better performance. I receive Your forgiveness today for [specific failure or sin]. Thank You that it can stay buried in Your grave. Help me to walk in the freedom of this truth. In Your precious name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Set aside 30 minutes for a private meeting with Jesus. Find a quiet place where you won't be interrupted. Bring to Him the specific failure or sin you've been avoiding discussing with Him. Imagine His response of grace and acceptance. Write down what you sense Him saying to you in this meeting.</p>
