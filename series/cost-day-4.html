                    <p>Matthew 16:21 (ESV)</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>The path of discipleship is costly—first for Jesus, then for us.</p>
                    <p>In Matthew 16:21, we see a pivotal moment in Jesus's ministry. After Peter's confession that Jesus is "the Christ, the Son of the living God," Jesus begins to reveal the cost of His mission. He "must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things... and be killed, and on the third day be raised."</p>
                    <p>Notice the word "must." This wasn't optional or incidental to Jesus's mission. It was necessary. The cross wasn't Plan B when Plan A failed. It was always the plan. Jesus came to die.</p>
                    <p>Why was this necessary? Because sin had created a chasm between humanity and God that only a perfect sacrifice could bridge. Because God's justice demanded payment for sin, and His love provided the payment Himself. Because, as Jesus would later say, "the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many" (Matthew 20:28).</p>
                    <p>The cost to Christ was immense. He would suffer physically—the scourging, the crown of thorns, the nails, the slow suffocation of crucifixion. He would suffer socially—the betrayal, the abandonment, the mockery, the shame of public execution. He would suffer spiritually—bearing the weight of the world's sin, experiencing the Father's wrath, crying out, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46).</p>
                    <p>This is what discipleship cost Jesus. Before He ever called us to take up our cross, He took up His. Before He ever asked us to deny ourselves, He emptied Himself. Before He ever invited us to lose our lives for His sake, He gave His life for ours.</p>
                    <p>Peter's response to this revelation is telling. He takes Jesus aside and rebukes Him: "Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you" (Matthew 16:22). Peter wanted a crown without a cross, glory without suffering, resurrection without death.</p>
                    <p>Jesus's reply is stern: "Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man" (Matthew 16:23). Jesus identifies this thinking as satanic—the same temptation Satan offered in the wilderness, a shortcut to glory that bypassed the cross.</p>
                    <p>This exchange reveals something profound about our own hearts. Like Peter, we often want a Christianity without cost, a discipleship without sacrifice, a crown without a cross. We want the benefits of following Jesus without the demands. We want His blessings without His lordship.</p>
                    <p>But Jesus is clear: there is no Christianity without the cross. First His, then ours. The path to life goes through death. The way to glory passes through suffering. The journey to resurrection begins with crucifixion.</p>
                    <p>Today, consider the cost that Christ paid for you. Let the reality of His suffering and death sink deep into your heart. Remember that before He called you to sacrifice, He sacrificed for you. Before He invited you to die to self, He died for your sins. His costly grace is what empowers our costly discipleship.</p>
                    <p>Jesus' journey to the cross was not an afterthought or a Plan B. From the moment He began His public ministry, He knew where it would lead. The cost of our discipleship is only possible because of the incredible cost Jesus paid for us.</p>
                    <p>Peter's reaction is understandable but misguided. He couldn't bear the thought of Jesus suffering and dying. But Jesus' response is stern and clear: "Get behind me, Satan!" Peter's thinking was focused on human perspectives rather than God's purposes.</p>
                    <p>The cost to Christ was immense. He willingly chose to leave the glory of heaven, take on human flesh, live a life of perfect obedience, and ultimately die a brutal death on the cross. All of this was necessary to pay the price for our sins and make discipleship possible.</p>
                    <p>When we consider the cost of discipleship, we must remember that Jesus paid the ultimate price first. Our sacrifices, no matter how great they may seem to us, are nothing compared to what He endured for us.</p>
                    <p>This perspective changes everything. When we understand the cost Jesus paid, our commitment to follow Him becomes a joyful response to His incredible love, not a begrudging obligation.</p>

                        <li>In what ways might you be like Peter, wanting the benefits of following Jesus without the cost?</li>
                        <li>How does Christ's willingness to suffer for you inspire your willingness to suffer for Him?</li>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Lord Jesus, I am overwhelmed by what it cost You to save me. Thank You for willingly going to Jerusalem, suffering many things, and being killed for my sake. Thank You for not taking the easy way out but enduring the cross for the joy set before You. Forgive me for the times I've wanted a Christianity without cost, a discipleship without sacrifice. Help me to embrace the way of the cross—first Yours, then mine. May Your costly grace empower my costly discipleship. In Your precious name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Spend time meditating on a passage that describes Christ's suffering and death (such as Isaiah 53, Psalm 22, or one of the Gospel accounts of the crucifixion). Write down specific aspects of His sacrifice that move you to gratitude and worship. Then identify one way you can respond to His sacrifice today through obedience or service.</p>
