                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>"Simon Peter said to them, 'I am going fishing.' They said to him, 'We will go with you.' They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing."</p>
                    <p>— John 21:3 (ESV)</p>
                    <p>"And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, 'Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.' And he went out and wept bitterly."</p>
                    <p>— Luke 22:61-62 (ESV)</p>

                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>Failure is a universal human experience. Peter fails big time. His story of failure is particularly dramatic because of the contrast between his bold promises and his actual performance. At the Last Supper, Peter confidently declared, "Lord, I am ready to die for you," yet within hours, he denied even knowing Jesus—not once, but three times.</p>
                    <p>This pattern is described as "good plans, no power." Peter had sincere intentions and genuine devotion, but when the pressure mounted, he discovered a gap between his aspirations and his abilities. How relatable this is! We often set out with the best of intentions—whether it's a New Year's resolution, a promise to a loved one, or a commitment to spiritual growth—only to find ourselves falling short when challenges arise.</p>
                    <p>Peter's failure was compounded by its public nature and its timing. He failed his Lord at the moment of Jesus's greatest suffering. The gospel of Luke tells us that after the third denial, Jesus turned and looked directly at Peter. Can you imagine that moment? The shame, the regret, the crushing weight of having failed someone you love deeply?</p>
                    <p>Yet Peter's story doesn't end with failure. In fact, his failure becomes the backdrop for one of the most beautiful restoration stories in Scripture. Peter's dramatic failure and restoration in John 21 shows that everyone, no matter how badly they've fallen, can experience a comeback through Jesus.</p>
                    <p>This is the hope we all need. Our failures, no matter how devastating, are not the end of our story when Jesus is involved. They can actually become the setting for His redemptive work in our lives. The path from failure to restoration begins with acknowledging the reality of our failure—not minimizing it or hiding from it, but facing it honestly.</p>
                    <p>As we begin this week-long journey exploring the road to restoration, take heart in knowing that the God who restored Peter is the same God who works in your life today. Your failures don't disqualify you from His love or His purposes. In fact, they might be the very place where His grace shines most brightly.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>What "good plans, no power" situations have you experienced in your life? Where have your intentions and your actions not aligned?</li>
                        <li>How do you typically respond to failure? Do you tend to hide, make excuses, or face it honestly?</li>
                        <li>Is there a particular failure in your life that still haunts you or that you haven't fully processed with God?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Heavenly Father, thank You for being a God of restoration and new beginnings. I confess that like Peter, I've had moments of "good plans, no power"—times when my actions haven't matched my intentions. Thank You that my failures don't define me or determine my future with You. Help me to face my failures honestly, without minimizing them or hiding from them. Give me the courage to begin the journey of restoration, knowing that Your grace is sufficient for my greatest shortcomings. Thank You that through Jesus, a comeback is always possible, no matter how far I've fallen. In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Take some time today to journal about a significant failure in your life. Write honestly about what happened, how it made you feel, and how it has affected your relationship with God and others. Then, write down this truth: "Through Jesus, this failure can become part of my comeback story." Keep this journal entry to refer back to at the end of this devotional week.</p>
