                <div class="scripture">
                    <h3>Scripture Reading</h3>
                    <p>The Pharisees went out and immediately held counsel with the Herodians against him, how to destroy him.</p>
                    <p>— Mark 3:6 (ESV)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="devotional-text">
                    <h3>Devotional</h3>
                    <p>Criticism comes with the territory of following Jesus.</p>

                    <p>In Mark 3, we see Jesus healing someone on the Sabbath—an act of compassion and restoration. Yet instead of celebrating this miracle, the religious leaders became angry. Their response seems baffling until we understand that criticism often reveals more about the critic than the one being criticized.</p>

                    <p>The passage shows us three types of critics Jesus faced, and these same types of critics still exist today:</p>

                    <p>First, there were the religious critics—the Pharisees. They didn't understand grace. In religious environments, people often feel they must pretend and perform. There's no room for honesty about struggles or failures. When someone finally has the courage to share something real, they're condemned rather than supported. The Pharisees didn't like Jesus because of who He associated with, because His influence was growing, and because He challenged their legalistic system.</p>

                    <p>Second, there were the political critics—the Herodians. Normally, the Pharisees and Herodians were enemies, but they united against Jesus because both saw Him as a threat. The Herodians supported Roman rule, while Jesus proclaimed a different kingdom. When Jesus's followers declared "Jesus is Lord," they were making a profound statement that challenged earthly authorities. Every totalitarian government has recognized this threat—that Christians acknowledge an authority higher than the state.</p>

                    <p>Third, there were the academic critics—the scribes from Jerusalem. These educated elites accused Jesus of being possessed by demons. They couldn't explain His power, so they attributed it to evil. Today, we still see intellectual elitism that dismisses faith as irrational or harmful.</p>

                    <p>What's remarkable is how Jesus responded to these critics. He didn't become defensive or bitter. He didn't water down His teaching to appease them. Instead, He continued His mission with clarity and purpose, knowing that criticism was inevitable for anyone challenging the status quo with God's truth.</p>

                    <p>When we face criticism for our faith—whether from religious people who think we're not following the rules correctly, from those who see our allegiance to Christ as threatening their worldview, or from intellectual voices that mock belief—we can take comfort in knowing Jesus faced the same. And we can follow His example of responding with truth, grace, and unwavering commitment to God's calling.</p>

                    <p>This is where community becomes essential. When criticism comes (and it will), we need brothers and sisters who will stand with us, remind us of our identity in Christ, and help us respond in ways that honor God rather than escalate conflict.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
                    <ol>

                        <li>How do you typically respond when your faith is criticized or questioned?</li>
                        <li>How might being in community help you face criticism more effectively?</li>

                <div class="prayer">
                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Lord Jesus, thank You for showing us how to face criticism with grace and truth. Help me to remember that when I face opposition for following You, I'm in good company. Give me discernment to know when to respond to critics and when to simply continue in faithfulness to Your calling. Surround me with people who will encourage me when criticism comes, and help me to be that kind of encouragement to others. May I never compromise Your truth to avoid criticism, but may I always speak that truth in love. In Your name I pray, Amen.</p>

                    <h3>Today's Application</h3>
                    <p>Think of a recent situation where you faced criticism for your faith or values. Write down how Jesus might have responded in that situation, and consider one specific way you could respond differently next time.</p>
